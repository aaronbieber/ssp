For fans of the hit AMC series Mad Men, or for fans of the '40s and '50s
in general, here is a splendid little video called "The Girl on the
Magazine Cover" that briefly investigates the world of modeling and
magazine advertising photography around the 1940s.

Not only is it a glimpse into the harrowing business of commercial
photography in those days when view cameras were the best you could get
and subjects were all shot under hot lights, but also an entertaining
look at the male-dominated professional world familiar to anyone who
lived through those decades (or at least watched Mad Men).
