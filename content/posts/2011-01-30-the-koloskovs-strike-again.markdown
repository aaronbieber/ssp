And by "strike" I definitely don't mean in the "strike out" sense, but
in the "I just struck gold" sense. The other day I posted [Tricks for
Shooting High-Key
Macro](/articles/2011/01/26/tricks-for-shooting-high-key-macro/)
wherein I link to a cool in-studio tutorial by Atlanta photographer Alex
Koloskov. Alex and his wife run AKELstudio in Atlanta, Georgia and are
now literally brain-dumping all of these great tutorials and
behind-the-scenes views onto the Internet and I'm loving every minute of
it.

Anyway, I really enjoyed Alex's high-key macro behind-the-scenes and
some of his in-studio video tutorials on shooting products under water
(if you want to check that out you can [read it
here](http://www.akelstudio.com/blog/water-in-still-life-and-advertisement-photography-episode-one/),)
and *then* I found out that his wife, Genia, is actually the Photoshop
mastermind behind all of AKELstudio's post-production and has her own
blog, too!

You may not know this about me, but my first contact with Photoshop was
in my middle school's computer lab. They had version 2.5, which was the
first version that shipped for Windows and also the last version that
_didn't_ have layers. Version 3 was shipped in 1994 and introduced
layers for the first time. I have been using Photoshop on and off since
then, and almost on a daily basis since version 5 or so. Needless to
say, I'm sort of a Photoshop junkie. To say that I "like" Photoshop
would be an understatement.

Another thing that has really excited me lately is HDR (or compressed
dynamic range, as it should properly be called, but that's a discussion
for another time). I just caught wind of this article Genia posted back
in June of outdoor HDR images that Alex photographed and she put
together using Photomatrix Pro (my favorite HDR program, by the way, you
should [buy it from Amazon right
now](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CIP12U?ie=UTF8&tag=singlservipho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002CIP12U)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=singlservipho-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002CIP12U))
and Photoshop.

Go and check out this HDR images. I really appreciate HDR that you can't
quite tell is HDR, though Genia does enjoy the more exaggerated HDR
effects as well, which is cool, I'm into that. You can hover your mouse
over each image to see one of the exposures from the "before" that
contributed to the final version.

You can do so much with Photomatix, I would highly recommend giving it a
try. You can [download a trial
version](http://www.hdrsoft.com/download).html from HDRsoft and if you
like it, please please please [buy it from
Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CIP12U?ie=UTF8&tag=singlservipho-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002CIP12U)
so I can keep paying my web hosting bills.
