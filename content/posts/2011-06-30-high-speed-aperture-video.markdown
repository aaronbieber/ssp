Continuing down this path we're on, looking into the inner workings of
our photographic equipment, here is yet another fabulous video from the
folks at [Camera Technica](http://cameratechnica.com) showing you what
the Canon 18-55mm aperture looks like when it opens and closes in slow
motion. Well, somewhat slow motion. The aperture actually opens and
closes so quickly that even in this high-speed video it's still a very
brief movement.

photographic technology.
