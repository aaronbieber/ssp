This Friday is the first day of our (that is, [Art Photo
Workshops](http://www.artphotoworkshops.com)) Chicago Loop photography
workshop. It's a three-day workshop focusing on the architecture and
culture of Chicago for photographers of all skill levels. This is
actually our first workshop of 2008, and we have a lot of great stuff
planned for later in the year, so keep an eye out.

If you guys have any ideas for workshops you'd be interested in, e.g.
places you'd like to go or themes you'd like to see covered, I'm all
ears. Leave a comment below or drop me an e-mail
(aaron-at-singleservingphoto.com). We are going to be doing some
workshops locally here in New England, probably in and around Boston,
New York City, Washington D.C., maybe Cape Cod, so if you're interested
in any of those ideas, feel free to drop me a line.

I haven't posted in quite a while because I've been spending all my time
working on building the website for Chris Blake's digital photo printing
company, Fine Art Ink. When it launches, you'll be able to instantly
create an account and start uploading images to print, choosing from a
whole array of high-quality, archival papers. Every paper on the site
will have an ICC profile available for download so that you can
soft-proof your images in Photoshop before sending them. Fine Art Ink is
outfitted with a cutting-edge wide-format printer capable of printing up
to 44 inches wide by 100 inches long!

We *love* feedback. If anyone has ideas or thoughts about what they'd
want to get out of a totally custom photographing printing service, feel
free to leave a comment here.
