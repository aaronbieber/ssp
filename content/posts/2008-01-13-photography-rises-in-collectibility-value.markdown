  content: "*I couldn't agree more.  I have been in the field over 25 years. The Digital
    age has change Photography as an Art form. Anyone with the latest soft ware can
    create works of Art. But Classical Photo Art will always out last most computer
    generated images.  All of my Black and White Photo Art is born inside a camera.
    \  \n*I want to bring Hand Tinting back into the main stream. Since we have our
    computers and high tech soft ware we fail to realize that computer generated imagery
    or photos are not the same as in the past. The reason is, that the computer lacks
    Zone \"A\" and Zone \"B\". Its merely a copy. All computer generated photos or
    prints will oxidize or fade. The sole purpose of making Photographs are to record
    or document historical events. Archiving Photos that are computer generated defeats
    this goal. In museums you will only find Black and White Photos, they know that
    any other type of print won't last long enough to achieve their objective. Digital
    Photography has its' place, and should be recognized as an Art form based on its
    content. \n*When we look back in the early 1800's we see images that were produced
    that still exist today. What if our Great masters used pixels to record there
    Art. They would have never dreamed of wasting there time and effort to gain fame
    by employing methods other than the Classical techniques to create their Art.
    When history is written, those who have negatives and Hand developed Prints will
    have works of Arts that will be priceless.\n*Don't miss out, if you can have the
    luck of buying a old Photo of the past, you will own tomorrows Picassos' Van Goghs'
    or even an Rembrandt.\n*The only worth while investment in todays Art Market will
    be a Hand Tinted Photograph. The other Great works of Art merely exchange owners
    and becomes more expensive in the process."

  content: Very interesting take on photography I must say. I find it kind of sad
    that photography have become this superior in relation with classical art. It
    isn’t any point to for artists to paint realistically anymore, since we can just
    take photos.

Nearly two hundred years after the invention of photography, creations
in the medium are finally being considered "safe" investments. The value
of photographs as collectibles is rising sharply, to the pleasure of
auction-goers and to the woe of some photographers.

Though paintings, sculptures, prints, and other works of fine art have
been spotlighted on the auction block for many years and for tremendous
money (works by Jackson Pollock and Gustav Klimt—to name only two—have
sold at auction for more than \$100 million apiece), the world of fine
art collectors has seldom been penetrated by even the most renowned
photographers.

This, however, is changing.~~MORE~~

Some of the most valuable photographs hold their rank by virtue of
historic value, such as Edward Steichen's _The Pond-Moonlight_, which
sold for nearly \$3 million at auction and was created using primitive
gum-based color photography techniques. Though sold as a photograph, it
was more likely to have been purchased as an artifact.

Diane Arbus, arguably an iconic 20th century photographer, has seen her
photographs sell at auction for only as much as \$478,000; not a small
sum to be sure, but merely a drop in the ocean by comparison to
paintings that regularly sell for between \$70 and \$140 _million_.

### Where's the Demand?

So why aren't collectors snapping up photographic prints at the same
rate they snap up paintings, sculptures, assemblages, mobiles, and
everything else? Why does photography carry this stigma within the
confines of the fine art world? Surely there have lived amazing artists
working within the photographic medium, so why aren't their creations
appreciating at the same rate as paintings and sculptures?

I can't answer those questions, but I can say that the tide may be
turning. Collectors are now starting to realize the investment potential
of fine art photography, especially at the current time when collectible
photography is still largely a bear market. As confidence is reinforced
by annual photography fairs in New York, Paris, and now London, the
value of fine art photographs will begin to climb.

### Prices Are Actually Meaningless

Before I get too deeply mired in the collectible photography discussion
and betray my true feelings toward selling art, let me take a step
backwards and point out that selling photography (or any art) at
auction, is vastly different from selling art to consumers.

From the standpoint of an artist, the final selling price of one of your
works at auction should not be interpreted as an editorial on your
abilities or the popularity of your work. Unfortunately for some, the
fine art collectors' marketplace is driven by people who want to make
money. These people have an interest in art, to be sure, but they are
looking for reliable investments, not the prettiest pictures for their
palatial libraries (though the two can occasionally coincide).

Widely acclaimed Indian photographer Raghu Rai put it very plainly,
"Most people are buying photographs because they consider it a trend to
cash in on. For them, it is just another investment, like shares or
property. It's not because they love the art."

### Hooray for Fine Art!

Nevertheless, this is an exciting trend for fine art photography.
Photographer Anay Mann says that "fine art photography has a longer
shelf life and is worth collecting, since it is the work of these
photographers that will appreciate in value over the years." A true
statement of promise for those of us toiling toward our own ends in the
world of photographic fine art.

Whether your work winds up at auction some day (perhaps even after your
death) or not is of little importance. The simple concession from
collectors and the "upper crust" of art buyers that photography is a
valid, collectible, and yes, valuable medium is a great boon to our
artistic legitimacy and to our profitability.
