    Neat-o.  I went to high school in Seaside while my dad was stationed at Fort Ord.  Unfortunately, that was before I got into photography, and what few photos I have of Monterey are from a 35mmP&amp;S.  (I did get to see them film part of Star Trek IV at the aquarium.)

    It's good to see that it's still as beautiful as ever.  Your photos are wonderful.

This morning I thought to myself, _It's been ages since I've posted
actual *photographs* on my *photo blog*_. I decided to remedy that
situation by showing off a little something I picked up in the Monterey
Aquarium (in Monterey, California) on Sunday.

This is more of a stock/photojournalism style of image that I don't
think fits in with the other images in my gallery, so Single-Serving
Photo is the perfect place for it!

A family enjoys one of the largest tanks at the aquarium, which is home
to _five hundred-pound tuna_.

There will be many, many more images to come as my California adventure
continues. I've taken approximately 950 photographs so far, picked out
at least 15 solid "keepers," and I still have three full days in San
Francisco ahead of me!

Keep an eye on the blog for further updates!
