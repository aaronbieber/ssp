Despite the almost _constant_ urge to do so, I have never posted one
of those "link wrap-ups" wherein I present you all with a bunch of links
I ran across over the course of the week (or month, or year) and expect
you to thank me for it.

I suppose it's because I feel cheap passing someone else's content along
without at least some sort of substantive editorial. Nevertheless, I do
read a _lot_ of blogs, not all of them photography-related, and I
often run across things that I think you guys and gals would be
interested in. It would be a shame for that to go to waste.

So today I bring you my very first ever *I Hate Link Wrap-Ups*
post.~~MORE~~

## Don't Get Scammed

Because I hate link wrap-ups, I will not simply list the links and say
_Have a nice day!_, but rather I will give you some reason(s) why I
think this is important information and some of my insights, which I
hope you'll find useful.

If you'd rather not listen to my chatter, just click the link and be on
your way.

[Of Zen and Computing: How to Avoid Getting Scammed When Buying a
Digital Camera](http://www.ofzenandcomputing.com/zanswers/996)

Of Zen and Computing is a blog concerned with lifestyle and workflow
issues unique to computer users and website authors, but now and then
(especially with digital photography taking a front-row seat) our
interests align. In this article, part of the site's Answers section,
the author describes some of the classic, sleazy tactics used by less
reputable retailers to get more money out of people who buy photography
equipment.

Without a doubt, good photography equipment can cost a bundle, but make
sure the cost is legitimate before you get caught in one of these
sinister plots.

## Storage Solutions

Digital photography has really begun to mix the worlds of art and
technology in fascinating new ways. One of the biggest issues that new
digital photographers face is _data storage_. Whether you're a
long-time photographer who just switched to digital, or a new
photographer who has chosen digital to begin with, the world of data
storage might be altogether new to you.

In additional to purely _storing_ your massive piles of RAW files,
Photoshop documents, and exported JPEGs, the issue of computational
power and equipment necessary to smoothly post-process those images also
comes into play. One very important characteristic of a photo editing
workstation is the _scratch disk_.

Both scratch disk space as well as storage systems (either for
continuous access or static backups) are very important to a
photographer with a large library of creative work. There have been
great leaps in storage technology lately, so I will share some of these
links with you.

### Western Digital's Raptor

[Western Digital 150 GB SATA
Raptor](http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=189)

Scratch disk space is what your operating system (or Photoshop) will use
when you've filled your RAM, or for certain types of data that don't
need to be accessed as quickly or repeatedly as what is placed in RAM.
Nevertheless, having a very fast scratch disk can improve performance
noticeably when editing photos.

The least expensive and least glamorous way to get some really fast
scratch disk space is to grab a Western Digital Raptor. With platters
spinning at a breakneck 10,000 RPM, it is the fastest internal hard
drive you can buy that will work with your modern PC or Mac tower (the
interface is Serial ATA--SATA for short).

One word of warning: these drives are pretty loud.

### SSD (Solid-State Disks)

This new SSD technology has no moving parts and instead uses something
they call NAND memory, which is something similar to CompactFlash or any
of those other memory technologies out there. I'm not an engineer, so
don't quote me on this, but what I know for sure is that these drives
have no moving parts, run entirely without noise, and are faster than
all get-out.

[Engadget's Coverage of SSD Drives](http://www.engadget.com/tag/ssd/)

My favorite gadget geek site, Engadget, has covered many manufacturers'
releases of SSD products and all of them are listed at that link. The
latest one, where they explore a RAID setup of SSDs, reaches disk
read/write speeds equivalent to gigabit ethernet. That's pretty darn
fast.

## Is Photography Art, What Is Art, Etc.

I love to wax philosophical about art and photography more than most
people, but over the past few days I have been literally _blown away_
by some of the insightful and well-articulated cogitation taking place
on The Online Photographer. I will eventually put together one or two
"reaction articles" of my own about this stuff, but if you want to read
some pretty daring ideas and reflections about photography, start here:

[Qualifying Photography As Art, or Is Photography All It Can
Be?](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2007/12/qualifying-phot.html)

The articles chronologically surrounding that one give even more depth
to the discussion.

That's a wrap.
