The absolutely wonderful and thorough camera review site
[dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com) has (finally) added _lenses_ to
its repertoire. Not only will they investigate lenses with the same
hands-on depth that their camera reviews enjoy, but they have also
rolled out a custom Flash-based, interactive widget that allows you to
change the settings of the lens and view its sharpness, chromatic
aberration, geometric distortion, and falloff (vignette) _live_ (small
screenshot to the right). I played with the tool for a little while and
was blown away by how easily it allows you to see what the real-life
sharpness of the lens is at different distances from center and at
different f-stops. Amazing.

If you want to,
[jump directly to the announcement on dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0801/08012913dpreviewlensreviews.asp),
or, for the really impatient,
[directly to the lenses](http://www.dpreview.com/lensreviews/).

They only have four lens reviews posted at the time of this writing, but
I'm sure there will be many more in the coming weeks. It can't be easy
to put together such incredibly detailed analyses.
