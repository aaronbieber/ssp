    You mentioned there were 12 articles, I can only see 10 and article 9 appears to be truncated to a single page.  Could you share the remaining two articles and perhaps article 9 with me?

    thanks.

  content: '@Shawn, I''m sorry I don''t have local archives of the articles; I guess
    they took down the last two. I''ll amend the post to indicate that; perhaps Google
    has a cache of them or something?'

Yes, you heard me. Free as in "no charge."

Over the course of two years, BBC-produced Wildlife Magazine published a
12-part series on photographing the locations and creatures of nature
written by talented photographers and including spectacular images.
Until now, you would've had to find the 12 specific issues of Wildlife
in order to read these tips, and for the effort it probably wouldn't
have been worth it. I, for one, am a lazy person, having grown up in the
age of the Internet where any and all useful information is a click
away, so rummaging through magazine back-issues is right out.

Fortunately for people like me, Wildlife has released all 12 "Photo
Masterclass" articles in PDF format on their website for free download.
Regrettably, the PDF files are print-restricted, so you can only view
them on a computer. If you have
[GoodReader](http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader).html on your iPhone or
iPod Touch, however, you can take these lessons with you wherever you
go. (GoodReader is how I take _every single Canon and Nikon DSLR
manual_ with me on [my workshops](http://artphotoworkshops.com;) I'll
write more about that later on).

To view and download all of the Photo Masterclass articles, [visit the
Photo Masterclass page on BBC
Wildlife](http://www.bbcwildlifemagazine.com/masterclasses.asp.)

[Edit: It appears that they have taken down articles 11 and 12; they no
longer appear on the site. Unfortunately I don't have local copies of
the articles to share with everyone, so they may be lost forever.\]
