In 1932, Ansel Adams and Edward Weston, among others, formed "Group
f/64" with the intent to "define photography as an art form by simple
and direct presentation through purely photographic methods."
(Wikipedia, [Group f/64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_f.64)) As
stated in their manifesto,

> Pure photography is defined as possessing no qualities of technique,
> composition or idea, derivative of any other art form. The production of the
> "Pictorialist," on the other hand, indicates a devotion to principles of art
> which are directly related to painting and the graphic arts.

Group f/64 was conceived in explicit opposition to the Pictorialist
movement, which "subscribed to the idea that art photography needed to
emulate the painting and etching of the time." (Wikipedia,
[Pictorialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictorialism)) Quite to the
contrary, Group f/64 believed very strongly that photography "must
always remain independent of ideological conventions of art and
aesthetics that are reminiscent of a period and culture antedating the
growth of the medium itself." (_ibid._) These are two very
different viewpoints. One sees photography as a medium through which to
create works representative of the predominant aesthetics and style of
other types of art at the time, and the other sees photography as a new
medium with its own aesthetics and style that should be preserved.

Purists almost by definition, the members of Group f/64 sought to
stretch the boundaries of photography through strict adherence to its
core methods. They used as few image-altering devices or techniques as
possible; no lens filters, no exotic darkroom processes or equipment.
Their images aspired to a crisp, infinitely-focused, tonally brilliant
standard upon which many future photographers would base their own
explorations.

It should be noted that although Ansel Adams used extensive, complicated
darkroom techniques on many of his most famous prints, he was both an
advocate of smart, precise post-processing as well as maintaining the
integrity of the medium by minimizing distortion of the subject, and it
was likely for the latter reason that he helped to form Group f/64.

But that was 1932. The "ideological conventions of art and aesthetics"
of 1932 have been entirely replaced in the age of the computer. Almost
in parallel to the 1932 Pictorialist/pure photography dichotomy, there
are those who see digital photography as a mere convenience; a new,
faster, and in some ways more inexpensive way to maintain similar
aesthetics to photography of the past, and there are those who see
digital photography as an entirely new medium.

I believe that both viewpoints are correct. However, digital photography
certainly brings with it a veritable cavalcade of new capabilities and
equipment, inheriting credibility and respect from its traditional,
silver halide forebears, but independent from them in all other ways,
both technical and aesthetic.

That being the case, what now embodies the "qualities of technique,
composition or idea" specific to "digital photography?" If a new group
came about with the same goals as Group f/64, but updated for digital
photography, what would its major tenets be? With such extensive editing
capabilities in the hands of even the beginner through Photoshop, Paint
Shop Pro, The Gimp, iPhoto, et. al., it goes without saying that
manipulation of the image is going to play a role. Whether it is basic
tonal adjustment and sharpening, or more drastic and potentially
destructive edits, such changes fall comfortably under the umbrella of
digital photography as a medium.

When Ansel Adams stood before the St. Hernandez valley on that day in
1941, he could see in his mind the process that would be used to bring
the exposure to life, from development to printing. It is that mastery
of craft that has perhaps been forgotten now that the capacity to make
hundreds, if not thousands, of exposures is available. This is one
impact of the digital revolution. Scarcity encourages innovation; when
there is less to work with, more attention is paid to planning and
execution to squeeze every drop of that creative juice out of the
moment.

Likewise, abundance breeds laziness. It's too easy to snap 100 exposures
of a subject in the hopes that one is in focus when each exposure costs
you nothing and with cameras capable of several exposures per second.

This article doesn't mean to draw conclusions. The ratio between
excellent photographers and poor photographers is likely to be much the
same today as it was in Ansel's time (counting only those who consider
themselves serious hobbyists and amateur professionals; photography is
no longer exclusive to the exceptionally passionate and the
exceptionally wealthy.) Still, digital photography raises a lot of
interesting questions and only time will tell how it will be treated by
the art historians of the future.
