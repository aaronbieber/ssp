The folks at my dentist's office were kind enough to let me spend a few
free moments snapping photos of their cool old X-Ray machine and such.
Big thanks to Dr. Berman and his entire crew.

I'm experimenting with the Mama Shanz cross-process actions in
Photoshop. Cross-processing refers to the development of some type of
film using chemicals intended for a different type of film. Typically,
slide film is developed in chemicals intended for 35mm film, which
produces exaggerated contrasts and funky colors. The cross-processing
effect was pretty big for a while in the '70s, as I understand it, but
with the advent of Photoshop it becomes easier to experiment with
similar effects without incurring the costs of chemicals and screw-ups.
Here are a couple of ideas.
