Scott Kelby, editor and publisher of _Photoshop User Magazine_,
_Layers Magazine_, and President of the National Association of
Photoshop Professionals (NAPP), took notice of my visual article on
histograms ([Histograms,
Huh?](/articles/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/)) and
linked it in a Monday links roundup on his blog, [Photoshop
Insider](http://www.scottkelby.com.)

I just want to say: thanks Scott, you definitely know quality when you
see it! You should all give Scott's blog a read, he provides information
from within the hallowed walls of NAPP and his publishing enterprise as
well as industry insights and lots of great photos.
