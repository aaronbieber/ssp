It's been a while since I've posted. I apologize to you all. While
enjoying an evening of Jackie Chan's Drunken Master (1978), I was able
to snap a couple of photos before my equally drunken yet
kung-fu-challenged friends started acting up.

I made a conscious decision to spare no Photoshop trickery in the quest
for the most arresting image. This decision is a direct result of
viewing Andrzej Dragan's [gallery of light painting
portraits](http://andrzejdragan.com/), achieved through a careful
attention to light and exposure during shooting followed by the most
impressive display of Rembrandt-esque manipulation I've seen.

So that's why I messed this one all up.
