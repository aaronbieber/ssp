I took the day off on Friday and went up to Cape Cod for the weekend to
see what all the fuss is about. Though I was born and raised here in New
England, for some reason I never visited and this seemed like the proper
time to correct that.

The weather wasn't exactly perfect, but when it stopped raining the
overcast skies provided a very soft and round light that made everything
glow.

Here is one that I think sums up the place and the experience, but
please do [view the rest of the
gallery](http://fisheyegallery.com/Places/CapeCod) for more!
