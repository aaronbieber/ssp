    DOT to Photographers: You’re Grounded!...

    A more positive reaction to the DOT's recently released guidelines on flying with lithium-based batteries. THE WORLD IS NOT ENDING FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS!...
---
The Department of Transportation's _Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration_, or PHMSA (I like to say it "pa-hum-sah" just to
be a jerk), dropped a bomb on us recently with a new set of regulations
governing lithium-based batteries in public transportation (chiefly air
travel, but presumably any transportation system under the DOT's
oversight).

Of concern are so-called _primary lithium_ or _lithium metal_
batteries as well as the somewhat more common _lithium ion_ batteries
so familiar to photographers. The regulations basically *prohibit*
loose spare batteries in checked baggage and also place a number of
other restrictions on the number and variety of batteries that can be
kept in carry-on luggage.

I became concerned because I will be flying out to the California coast
at the end of February to scout locations for future [art photography
workshops](http://www.artphotoworkshops.com) and making that voyage
across the country is enough of a hassle without TSA inspectors throwing
all of my batteries away.

Here I will make a valiant effort to summarize what has already been
said by others and tell you why I think this "emergency" might be
somewhat blown out of proportion. Continue after the jump! ~~MORE~~

## The Facts

Before I get into the details of this new set of rules, you should
probably know what the rules actually say. So, for your convenience,
here is the actual DOT PHMSA press release in full:

> Contact: Patricia Klinger or Joe Delcambre
>  Tel.: (202) 366-4831

> New US DOT Hazmat Safety Rule to Place Lithium Battery Limits in
> Carry-on Baggage on Passenger Aircraft Effective January 1, 2008
>
> Passengers will no longer be able to pack loose lithium batteries in
> checked luggage beginning January 1, 2008 once new federal safety
> rules take effect. The new regulation, designed to reduce the risk of

> "This rule protects the passenger," said Lynne Osmus, Federal Aviation
> Administration (FAA) assistant administrator for security and
> hazardous materials. "It's one more step for safety. It's the right

>
> In addition to the new rule, PHMSA is working with the FAA, the
> National Transportation Safety Board, the Consumer Product Safety
> Commission, the battery and airline industries, airline employee
> organizations, testing laboratories, and the emergency response
> communities to increase public awareness about battery-related risks

For the *extremely intrepid*, you may read the [actual final
rule](http://www.labsafety.com/refinfo/fedreg/FRPDF/080907).pdf on
labsafety.com. It's 22 pages long, so get a cup of coffee.

On the Safe Travel website (which is an arm of the DOT and PHMSA), more
specific guidelines are provided than what was in the press release.
Feel free to [read Safe Travel's
synopsis](http://safetravel.dot.gov/whats_new_batteries).html as well
if you like. It's not too long.

For the record, I don't think I've ever seen a _primary lithium_
battery before. All of my lithium-based batteries are _lithium ion_,
which are much less volatile and are subject to slightly different
rules. I will presume that we're only talking about lithium ion
batteries from here on out.

## The Concerns

The danger of having lithium batteries floating around in luggage is
twofold. First, there is some concern about batteries getting shorted
out and causing fires in the cargo hold where fire suppression is
mechanized and not as effective as people in the cabin area with fire
extinguishers. Second, if a lithium battery were to catch fire by some
means, it is possible that it could explode. So you can imagine the
DOT's concerns.

Safe Travel's release about these new rules is fairly specific about
what sorts of batteries you can't bring on the plane, but rather than
parroting their website, I'll break it down into the important bits.

## The Rules

* You really shouldn't pack your spare batteries in your checked
luggage because the TSA inspectors have the right (and yes, the
responsibility) to remove them and throw them away if they believe them
to be a safety hazard. At between \$25 and \$50 per battery, why take
the risk?
 * These new rules do not set any quantity limitations on batteries
containing fewer than eight "equivalent grams" of lithium. Basically,
all of your batteries are likely to be excluded from this rule. I will
get into the specifics below.
 * Batteries that are not lithium-based are definitely excluded from
these rules. Make certain that you are aware of what your batteries are
made out of. For example, the Canon EOS-1d, 1ds, 1d Mark II, and 1ds
Mark II use nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, so take as many as
you want.

## Let's Do Some Math

What on Earth is eight equivalent grams of lithium? Well, the DOT says
that eight equivalent grams of lithium are present in a battery with
approximately 100 watt-hours (wh) of power. So, how much is that?

We can figure it out pretty easily. A standard Canon BP-511A battery
(used by all Canon _prosumer_ cameras such as the Rebel, 10D, 20D,
30D, 40D, 5D, and on, and on) is rated at 1,390 milliamp-hours (mAh),
which means that if you pulled one milliamp of current out of the
battery per hour, it would last for 1,390 hours. Another way to say it
is that if you pulled 1,390 milliamps of current out of the battery, it
would last for one hour.

We can convert 1,390 milliamps to watts by assuming a time period of one
hour. Ahem, here is a formula:

W = V × A

Watts is equal to volts multiplied by amps. This battery is 7.4 volts
and we'll say it's pushing 1,390 milliamps, or 1.39 amps.

W = 7.4V × 1.39A
 W = 10.286VA

Because we assumed a time unit of one hour, we can say that this battery
has a power rating of roughly 10wh (10 watts × 1 hour). Making any
sense?

Clearly 10wh is far below the 100wh rating necessary to reach eight
equivalent grams of lithium, so it's safe to say that our little BP-511A
battery is pretty far away from being subject to these new rules. It's
really important to note that the DOT doesn't care how many batteries
you have that contain fewer than eight equivalent grams of lithium, nor
do they care how much aggregate lithium there is in your carry-on. The
concern is only for batteries with eight or more equivalent grams
_each_.

## Taking Precautions

Just because you're a whiz kid with a calculator and you are
functionally literate doesn't mean that the TSA folks won't hassle you
if they feel like you aren't being safe. So, to prevent unnecessary
headaches, the Safe Travel website recommends the following important
procedures:

* Pack spare batteries in carry-on baggage. In the passenger
compartment, flight crews can better monitor safety conditions to
prevent an incident, and can access fire extinguishers, if an incident
does happen.
 * For loose batteries, place tape across the battery's contacts to
isolate terminals. Isolating terminals prevents short-circuiting.
 * If original packaging is not available, effectively insulate battery
terminals by isolating spare batteries from contact with other batteries
and metal. Place each battery in its own protective case, plastic bag,
or package. Do not permit a loose battery to come in contact with metal
objects, such as coins, keys, or jewelry.

The first one echoes my intuition about keeping expensive batteries
close as hand if possible, to keep an eye on them. The second and third
points are of interest to me because I normally pack a couple of
Canon-brand BP-511As as well as a handful of cheaper, third-party
BP-511A lookalikes, which do not come with the handy plastic covers that
would satisfy those suggestions.

Fortunately, there is a Yahoo! store called [Green
Batteries](http://www.greenbatteries.com/repbatforcan1).html that is
selling those little doodads for \$1.77 (or four for about \$5.50, which
is about \$1.40 each). I plan to pick up a bunch of those and make sure
all of my batteries are properly insulated from external contact.

I travel with a Tamrac CyberPack, which has individual battery pockets
in the outer compartment, but when it comes to TSA inspectors, I always
give them the benefit of the doubt. For \$10, it's just peace of mind.

If any of you good folks fly with your gear in the coming months, please
do write me with your experiences, positive or negative. Leave a comment
on this post, or just drop me an email (aaron at singleservingphoto dot
com), I'd love to hear from you.
