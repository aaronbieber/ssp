That's "image stabilization" for those of you not paying attention. Or
"VR" for the Nikon folks out there. I believe Canon and Nikon use very
similar electronic systems. Either way, this is fascinating. This is
what the inside of a Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM lens looks like
when the image stabilization is operating.
