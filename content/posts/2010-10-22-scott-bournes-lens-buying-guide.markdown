Just like HAM radio enthusiasts (of which I am one, by no coincidence),
photographers tend to be whores for equipment. If there is one thing
that's more exciting than actually taking pictures, it's buying all the
equipment you think you need before even going out there. Some call it
"retail therapy," which is a deceptively medical phrasing for "it feels
really good to buy stuff, and I enjoy feeling really good."

Whether you need this junk or not is a completely different question,
and one that I could certainly answer for you, but I doubt you'd listen
to me. Who am I, anyway, other than another guy who loves buying stuff
he doesn't need?

You know who you should listen to? Scott Bourne.

I've been writing this blog for a little over five years now, which
seems like a long time to me, but Scott has been writing about and
teaching photography for _six times that long_ (yes, thirty years), so
he deserves your attention for at least the next ten minutes... Which is
all it's going to take you to breeze through his newly updated [DSLR
Camera Lens Buying
Guide](http://photofocus.com/2010/10/20/dslr-camera-lens-buying-guide/)
on Photofocus.

Within the Guide, Scott offers tips for choosing what to buy and gives
examples of each basic type of lens in both Canon and Nikon flavors.

For all of you Sony, Panasonic, Olympus, and Minolta shooters out there,
don't worry... I'm sure there's another blog out there for you guys! Ha
ha!

But seriously, these are good tips and you should listen to what Scott
has to say, he speaks from immense experience.
