    Ultimate Travel Photography Checklist...

    Never forget an essential piece of gear again with the ULTIMATE TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHY CHECKLIST....
---
I'm traveling all over the place this year teaching [art photography
workshops](http://artphotoworkshops.com), but I am also notoriously
disorganized. So when I saw an article about [the ultimate grocery
list](http://www.grocerylists.org/ultimatest/), I knew I had to make a
*checklist for travel photographers* to keep track of all their
essential gear.

Now I know I'm not exactly [Chase
Jarvis](http://chasejarvis.com/blog/2007/11/chase-jarvis-tech-packing-photography.html)
when it comes to packing and transporting gear, but I'd like to think
I've thought of all the important things.

<div
style="background: white url('http://static.artphotoworkshops.com/UltimateTravelChecklistScreenshot.gif') no-repeat -70px 0px; height: 200px; width: 600px; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

The list was designed to be printed on a regular letter-size piece of
paper, and it's in PDF format, so if you want to print it really tiny or
really big, the choice is yours. [Download the original
PDF](http://artphotoworkshops.com/read/UltimateTravelPhotoChecklist)
(it's only about 40k) and never forget your essential gear again!
