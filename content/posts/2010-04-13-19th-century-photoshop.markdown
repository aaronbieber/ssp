![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/1860lincoln1.jpg "Lincoln Portrait")

I have a question to ask you. What do Santa Claus, this portrait of
Lincoln, and great daytime television have in common?

That's right, they're all mythical. Well, actually, the portrait is
_real_ inasmuch as it physically exists, but it's one of the earliest
(now rather famous) examples of photo manipulation. It turns out that
although the photo seems to depict a stoic Lincoln standing beside a
writing desk, the only thing in that photo that is actually Lincoln's is
his head. The body is that of Southern politician [John C.
Calhoun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Calhoun).

Apparently, so few "heroic" portraits of Lincoln existed (perhaps
because Lincoln was weary of posing for them) that the only logical
alternative was to fake it. In addition to pasting Lincoln's head onto
Calhoun's body, the text on the papers visible on the desk were changed
from "strict constitution," "free trade," and "the sovereignty of the
states" to "constitution," "union," and "proclamation of freedom."

So who needs Photoshop, anyway?
