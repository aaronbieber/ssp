The Internet is all a-flutter about this [announcement Greg Yaitanes
made](http://twitter.com/GregYaitanes/status/11731103539) via Twitter
that the House, M.D. season finale (airing next month on FOX) was shot
_entirely_ with a Canon EOS-5D Mark II. This makes the 5D Mark II the
first video-capable digital SLR camera to ever have been used to film a
"prime time" television episode.

Yaitanes, who is a co-executive producer and director of House, M.D.,
said that they chose the 5D Mark II because they wanted to be able to
fit the camera into "tight spaces," they used mostly Canon prime lenses
as well as the 24-70 and 70-200 zooms, and that no brackets or
stabilization tools were used. I can't wait to see how the episode
looks!

The video was recorded onto large CF cards (Yaitanes said "18gb," but I
think he meant 16 GB), which afforded only 22 minutes of shooting before
tossing in a new card.
