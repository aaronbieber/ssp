Posts have been sparse here these days, and for that I apologize. I have
taken up a new hobby: amateur radio. I just passed my exam this week and
got my license. If any of you out there are hams, keep your ears open

deserve to be viewed larger and in the dark. Try to squint or something
maybe. These are along what we call "the flats" in the Farmingon
