Sometimes I go to these crazy college parties. Sometimes I bring my
camera and stick it in people's faces.

Warning: Techy nerd talk ahead! There is some grain due to
ISO(International Standards Organization) 1600. I try to stay at 800 or
below (400 to be safe) but since this is experimental and I hate the
flash I gave it a go. The results were better than I expected.
