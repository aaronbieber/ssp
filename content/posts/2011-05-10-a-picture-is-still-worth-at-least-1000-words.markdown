The old adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" has been around
since at least the '20s--according to Wikipedia--and it's just as true
today as it was then. The phrase refers to our ability to absorb
information faster in a visual mode than in a reading mode. Perhaps this
has something to do with the fact that all living creatures are born
with the ability to see and to recognize (to varying degrees), but
humans' ability to write is something that we created.

As photographers, we are acutely aware of the truth in that statement.
If you had to describe just one of your photographs in enough detail for
someone else to draw it, which only touches the very mechanical surface
of the depth of content that a photograph can represent, it would
certainly take thousands of words. But never was this statement more
_demonstrably_ true than this month, May of 2011.

I don't usually write about current events outside of the photography
trade, but in this case I will make an exception because it has
significant relevance to us. Only days ago, American special forces
raided a compound in Pakistan and killed Osama bin Laden, the man
responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
towers and for countless other acts of terrorism around the globe.

When the military undertakes an operation like this they are very
careful to document everything and this case was no exception. It is now
well known that at least one gruesome photograph of a shot-in-the-head
Osama bin Laden exists, but such a photograph has not been released,
under any circumstances or terms, to anyone.

*More is shown of the true power of the photograph by this particular
photograph's _absence_ than would ever have been shown by its
release.*

The Obama administration is acutely aware of what could happen if people
were shown this "incendiary image," as journalist Sean O'Hagan
[described it in The Guardian last
Friday](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/may/06/osama-bin-laden-photograph-obama-body).
By every measurement, this type of documentary recording is an area
where the photograph has always held at least an assumed power, though
the public may not give it much thought. This power is what keeps
photojournalists in business and they hone their craft to amplify its
effects. Still, if there is any greater moral to this story, it is that
photography is a truly influential medium and there could be no higher
calling than to use its emotional and instructive abilities for good.
