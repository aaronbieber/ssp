It is probably clear to you by now, my gentle (and oh, so loyal)
readers, that I'm making up for lost time today. I have been sitting on
piles of article ideas and photography news items to share with you all
but unfortunately at times life can get the better of you, as it has me
over the past couple of months.

Please rest assured that I have no forgotten you all, nor have I given
up on this "blogging" endeavor of mine. Regrettably, many of the things
that have occurred in the photography world during my absence are no
longer relevant or current, but fear not, for there is much, much more
to share.

Now, to the point.

Clearly this is a photography website and I try to limit my ramblings
and reflections to the world of photography, but occasionally something
comes around that is only tangentially related to photography, such as a
video or a piece of news, and it behooves me to let you decide whether
you think it's interesting or not.

In this case, we have 560,000 photos of a firecracker exploding. I
apologize for the perhaps somewhat misleading title; these are not
560,000 individual photographs, but rather the result of recording 56
seconds of a firecracker exploding on a high-speed camera at 10,000
frames per second. I ask you, is there anything in the world that
doesn't look amazing at 10,000 frames per second? Don't answer that.

One of the most compelling capabilities of photography, which I have
featured prominently in my own [artist's
statement](/articles/2010/03/15/your-artists-statement/),
is that of enabling us to see something we cannot perceive with our own
bare eyes. What is hidden from us may be the unique perspective of
another individual in a philosophical or social sense, or something that
is literally invisible to the naked eye. In my humble opinion it is
photography's highest calling to reveal it. In this case it is a "moving
picture," a video if you will, but nevertheless photography's calling is
answered triumphantly.

Without further ado, a firecracker exploding at 10,000 frames per
second:
