If any of you occasionally visit The Luminous Landscape, you may have
noticed that it's not available right now (visitors are met by a 404
error on the front page; never good!)

Michael Johnston over at The Online Photographer has spoken to Michael
Reichmann and [informs
us](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2010/12/luminous-landscape-will-be-back-soon).html
that the site experienced a fatal crash and is currently in the process
of being restored from a backup. If they've crossed their Ts and dotted
their Is, everything should be back up again soon.

Having gone through more than one fatal server crash, I know how
nerve-racking it can be (and my site gets around 1% of the traffic of
The Luminous Landscape!) Best of luck to Michael and his crew in getting
things running again!
