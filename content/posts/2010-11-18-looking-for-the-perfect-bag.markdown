Yeah, I bet you are. I have around five bags, both shoulder bags and
backpacks; in my circle of friends that's a _low number_. It seems
like photographers are always buying new bags. No bag you buy is ever
perfect, there's always a new bag later on that you feel will better
satisfy your lifestyle or your methods or your comfort.

So, how do you shop for a camera bag?

* Go into B&H's Manhattan super store and try 50 bags and buy the one
you like most?
 * Read reviews on Google Shopping and Amazon.com and B&H's website and
decide based purely on others' experiences?
 * Wallpaper your dining room with the camera bag pages from B&H's
amazingly detailed printed catalog and throw darts at them?

I've used each of those methods, but they're all a bit tedious.

*Fear not*, for the Internet has come to your rescue yet again. [Bag
Exposure](http://www.bagexposure.com/) is an entire website dedicated to
reviewing camera bags. It looks like they've gotten started not too long
ago, and the collection of reviews is not _exhaustive_, but if you're
looking for a bag, this might be a good resource to check out first.
