To say that photographing the fireworks display in Washington, D.C. is a
challenge might be hyperbole. Compared to those in Boston and New York
City, which I've photographed two times each, getting a reasonable spot
to shoot from is a cakewalk.

The National Mall opens at around 10 AM, but even at 3 PM there are
still plenty of good spots by the Lincoln Memorial, so there's no need
to hurry. The real challenge, it would seem, is the complete and total
lack of information about the strategy and considerations of shooting in
the heart of the nation's capital.~~MORE~~

Have you ever searched for photographs of the D.C. fireworks? You should
give it a try. Go ahead, I'll wait.

There aren't many. That is to say, there aren't many great ones. It
seems as though Getty and other stock agencies own most of the truly
decent shots that exist. There are a few out there by random bloggers,
or that you may find on Flickr, but it isn't a landslide such as you
will find when you search for New York City fireworks photos.

## Where, When?

Okay, so there are enough shots to know where you want to shoot from, at
least; there are a couple of decent opportunities. Many of the "classic"
shots are made from the Tidal Basin near the Jefferson Memorial. From
there you can frame a shot with the Potomac in the foreground and the
Washington Memorial, Capitol, and Lincoln Memorial as your main
subjects.

For a closer vantage, any of the areas around the front of the Lincoln
Memorial should be ripe for the picking, and that's where I shot from
this year. You can almost tell where I was located when I took the photo
below.

Reports of when the crowds start to accumulate around the National Mall
are hard to find. Depending upon who you ask, you get entirely different
answers. In order to best maximize the opportunity (for which I spent
the better part of a day in a car from Connecticut), I decided to get to
the National Mall as early as possible.

Things I _totally_ didn't have to do:

* Get to the National Mall as early as possible,
 * Sit at the location I wanted to shoot from for 10 hours under the
97-degree sun,
 * Forget to bring a folding chair.

So let me give all you guys and gals out there a hint. You don't have to
get to the National Mall _ten hours early_ to snag a good location to
photograph the fireworks display from. Unlike Boston and New York City,
which both require a photographer's attendance ten or more hours in
advance, you can probably do very well at 3 PM in most places.

This is where the information bottleneck becomes the _limiting
reagent_ in the complex experiment of great Washington, D.C. fireworks
photos. If only someone had told me, reliably, that I could get to the
National Mall at 3 PM, would stand in essentially _no line_ to go
through the security checkpoint, and could still set up my tripod almost
anywhere I wished... That would have been nice.

Oh, right, security checkpoints, I almost forgot.

## Security Checkpoints

Before the 4th of July celebration, an enormous fence is erected around
the entire National Mall. In order to get in, you will have to pass
through one of the security checkpoints placed around the perimeter and
be subjected to a search. At least, this was the gist of what my
research turned up when looking into the logistics of this little
photographic adventure.

Here's what you actually have to know, based on my experience:

*_They don't actually care what you bring in._*

No knives, explosives, or personal grills. No glass bottles,
thermonuclear weapons, chainsaws, etc. No alcohol, either (officially),
but if you want to bring around nineteen coolers of food and drinks, a
tent canopy, a load of chairs, towels, beach balls, and anything else
you can reasonably carry, yeah, they'll let you in.

Suffice it to say, a huge camera bag and a tripod isn't going to be an
issue, despite online warnings of "they won't let you in with a bag,"
etc., etc. They will need to look inside your bag, but it's cursory and
they aren't even allowed to _touch_ anything. They will use a wooden
stick to poke around and make sure they can see everything inside.

*_It's fast._*

I was lined up with everyone else by 9:30 on the 4th, waiting for the
security sweep of the park to complete and the checkpoints to open. That
was the largest line I was ever in, and I was through within 10 minutes
of when it opened up. I left the park area and came back in the early
afternoon and essentially walked through without waiting at all. So
don't sweat the lines.

*_Crowd control. It's an illusion._*

Whenever you're photographing fireworks, no matter what the location or
occasion, you have to learn to _hold your ground_. Whether it's
another photographer or a particularly ambitious spectator, people will
encroach on your space if you don't make your boundaries known.
Fortunately for you, the intrepid Washington D.C. fireworks
photographer, you won't have to deal with any serious crowd issues until
around 5 or 6 PM. That's when you're going to start getting surrounded.

This is all very foreign to me, with experience only in the "Big Apple"
and "Beantown." I assumed that by the time the gates opened, a sea of
tripods and camera bags would stretch out before me, blanketing every
good vantage point imaginable... And that simply was not so.

Comparatively, photographing the fireworks show in Washington, D.C. was
one of the easiest fireworks shows I have ever photographed.
