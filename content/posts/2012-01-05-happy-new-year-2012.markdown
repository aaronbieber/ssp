First and foremost, a happy new year to all of you, my lovely readers.
Whether you check in now and then or have been a reader for several
years, it is solely for you that I do this. Believe me, when I talk to
myself I don't do nearly as much editing.

Anyway, what better way to ring in the new year and to step back from
the commotion of life, if only for a moment, to appreciate the bigger
picture than... With a picture? A picture exactly one year in the
making, in fact.

Michael Chrisman, a 31-year-old photographer living in Toronto, set up a
small pinhole camera on January 1, 2010, overlooking the city's skyline.
On new year's eve, he collected it. The developed picture is shown to
the right, and I have to say, I love it. ~~MORE~~

In the image you can clearly see the trails of the sun across the sky,
each one tracing a slightly different path as the Earth tilts on its
axis through the course of the year. You can see the reflections in the
water, and you can easily make out the CN Tower, Toronto's most distinct
fixture.

Think about this for a minute. A tiny pinhole sat open for 31.5 million
seconds, sending beams of light toward a piece of photographic paper,
capturing an image that by itself represents a year of activity. Three
hundred and sixty five revolutions of our planet around its sun.

It's a great way to put life in perspective, I think. I wish you all the
best in 2012, stay tuned for more photography talk in the coming weeks.
