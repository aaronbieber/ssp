No, no, not you. Other digital artists, like those guys who spend ten
days recalibrating all of their equipment before developing each
photograph. I hope you don't do that.

What I mean by "functionally retarded" is, ironically, that these
artists are smart---very smart. Genius level, in some cases. However,
their intelligence draws them into an *irrational attention to detail
and measurement*, which incurs a logarithmic increase in effort for
each fractional gain in image quality.

As a digital artist, you are faced with an ever-expanding array of tools
that can be brought to bear on your work. The mere existence of such
tools is an invitation, to some, to spend the rest of their lives
tweaking and re-developing a single image, printing it on every possible
paper, using every possible ink combination, surface treatment, and
mounting option. This is not what I would call art, it is
_completionism_, pure and simple.<!--more-->

* _Video gaming._ One who seeks to unlock every secret and acquire every bonus
  in a game.

* One who seeks to explore every potential facet of a problem area and implement
  the most exhaustive, imperforate solution.

_Antonym_, incrementalist.

There is a certain enjoyment to be derived from discovering better ways to do
things. Surely in my own work I have spent countless hours trying different
approaches to development challenges, applied newly learned Photoshop
techniques, and prepared images for print in different ways until I settled on
what I thought worked best.

The type of completionist that this diatribe is focused on, however, is he or
she who ruminates at great length over technical minutia, arguing the
theoretical proofs of each item's superiority. Surely it is important to have an
understanding of the mechanisms at play in one's work, but do you produce
recognizably better art when you have round-tripped your photo through the LAB
color space to maximize each pixel's adjustment potential?

Depending upon what type of work you do, perhaps. Though I think for the average
photographer (and I mean average in the statistical sense), understanding the
broad strokes of the technology involved allows for at least 95% of the possible
image quality to be achieved. The few percent toward unachievable perfection
come at a cost almost too great to consider, unless that journey is one you
savor, or you're independently wealthy and have time enough to spend on it.

Each photographer must, as a necessity, evaluate his or her own final product,
criticize it, and grade it. If it is found to be lacking in some way, a solution
to that shortcoming certainly exists. Weigh each problem against its solution
until you have reached the best possible product _for you_.

My point is simply this. That Professional Photographer X says better results
are gained by performing Process Y is no reason in itself to change your
workflow. Try the technique, see how long it takes and whether its marginal
gains are worthwhile for your style and in your own eyes. Only then should
specific, technical proofs have any influence on your work.
