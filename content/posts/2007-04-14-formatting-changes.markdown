I've been putting some work into the site lately, mostly on the
back-end, but you will notice (hopefully) that the text of the posts is
quite a bit larger and I can now also use headings to break up those
really long articles to help you find the bits you're interested in. My
aim is to make the site as accessible as possible and hopefully pretty
to look at, too.

I'm always open to suggestions for how the site can better serve you, my
loyal readers, so don't hesitate to write a comment here on this post,
or e-mail me if you have any ideas. Cheers!
