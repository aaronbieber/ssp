"Women with kiwis on their eyes"){:.frame}](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/102173.jpg)

Stock photography has officially achieved _critical mass_ in the
absurdity department. I grant you, stock photographers are as much
instruments of the marketplace as any other professional service
provider and are therefore subject to the whims of the focus groups, the
advertising big wigs, the ebb and flow of the dollars that keep them
knee-deep in lenses and strobes. But when was the last time you saw a
product advertised by a stock photograph and thought to yourself, _That
could totally be me in that picture_?

There you are, holding a slice of kiwi in front of each eye, like any
normal Tuesday, right? You look so happy about this kiwi you could make
a _coke addict_ jealous. The look on your face is one of such
unbridled joy, such boundless euphoria, it would be hard for any
bystander not to want your life at that moment.

Dear stock photographers... Quit it! ~~MORE~~

I'm not going to try to say that pictures of women ecstatically eating
salad, men jumping up in the air in business suits, or families in
pastel clothing not looking at each other are unnecessary or devoid of
value. Quite to the contrary, if the market demands photos of people
just about to take a bite of something delicious with a look of
drug-induced bliss on their perfectly lit faces, that is what the market
shall receive.

No, I'm only saying, really, seriously, don't we have enough of these
yet? Where's the originality, where's the inspiration? Where's the
_creativity_, people?!

The ad agencies are just as much to blame for this, flipping through
their iStockPhoto dot coms and their Getty libraries and always choosing
the group of conveniently diverse people huddled around a clipboard with
blank paper on it instead of something, oh I don't know, _realistic_.

Cracked does a phenomenal job of pointing out just how ridiculous and
profuse some of these archetypical images have become, in the article
linked below. Just a word of warning: there is some coarse language,
which is uncommon for my blog, and is the only reason I mention it.
