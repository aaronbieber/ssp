    Bold Street Photography with Bruce Gilden...

    Great story and video of Bruce Gilden and his direct way of photographing people on the streets of New York.  I'm not this brave!...

I just watched this _entrancing_ short movie about Magnum photographer
Bruce Gilden, known for his up-close and personal imagery from the
streets of New York City.

Note how Gilden gets right up to people and even puts an off-camera
flash directly in front of their faces. I was amazed at how unabashed he
was with his shooting. Gilden is quoted as saying, "I'm known for taking
pictures very close, and the older I get, the closer I get."

I have to admit that photographing people in a street setting actually
makes me a little uneasy because I'm always concerned about someone
getting angry, but apparently that is not a problem for Gilden.
