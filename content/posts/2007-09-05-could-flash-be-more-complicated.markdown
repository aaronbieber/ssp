It's not so much that flash photography is actually _complex_, but
more that the available information tends to skip _the fundamentals_.
In short, I love [Strobist](http://www.strobist.com) very much (and I'm
not alone), but I felt left in the dark (pun intended) about a couple of
small items after reading a recent post and I felt I should share the
answers I came up with.~~MORE~~

## Land of Confusion

So there I was, reading this [Balance Light:
Twilight](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2007/09/lighting-102-balancing-light-twilight.html)
post on Strobist, which is admittedly part of the second and more
advanced series on lighting (Lighting 102), but nevertheless I became
overwhelmed with total misunderstanding. I don't want to be too quick to
discredit David because, after all, it *was* Lighting 102, so maybe I
missed something that was discussed earlier, but all of the examples of
aperture and shutter settings raised a boat load of questions in my
mind.

Questions that burned within me!

## Time Is of the Essence

My first question, and the simplest one, was how flash lighting actually
interacts with aperture and shutter settings. What I didn't realize is
that the exposure of an object lit entirely by your flash is _not
affected in any way by your shutter speed_. The easiest way to explain
why this is true is to discuss _maximum sync speeds_. All mid- to
high-end Canon cameras have a maximum sync speed of 1/250th of a second,
which means that you can set your shutter to anything _up to_ 1/250th
while using a synchronized flash (which is to say, any flash that is
fired by the camera, either using a sync cable, wireless system, or
master/slave setup). With the high-end Nikons, I believe you can get
1/500th. The maximum sync speed represents the shortest length of time
during which your camera can _guarantee_ that the flash will turn on
*and* turn off.

By definition, if your shutter speed is set to the maximum sync speed or
slower, your camera is guaranteeing that its shutter will be open for at
least the entire duration of the flash's discharge, exposing your image
to all of its generated light (by "all" I mean the brightness as well as
duration components).

I had never really thought about it that way before.

## What About TTL?

My other big question was how this _house of cards_ you've
meticulously built up by manually adjusting all of your settings could
possibly be _thrown asunder_ by the TTL (or A-TTL or E-TTL) metering
that the camera does. If you are using a TTL-capable flash unit on your
Canon camera, the camera will be able to adjust the duration of flash
discharge to get the "proper" exposure.

Any recent Canon camera and flash system is able to use what they call
E-TTL, which means "evaluative through-the-lens" metering. E-TTL meters
the flash by firing a "pre-flash" milliseconds before the actual flash
and measuring its effect on the scene using the same through-the-lens
metering system that meters non-flash photographs. Because the pre-flash
is a set intensity, all of the variables are known to the camera and the
result of the actual flash exposure can be calculated. It seems almost
impossible, but it works.

So the short answer to my question is that the metering system _will_,
theoretically, change the results of whatever settings you have
selected. However, the E-TTL system should be "smart" enough to properly
expose the scene _for flash_, meaning that whatever adjustments you
make to the ambient light's exposure should be virtually unaffected.
E-TTL simply ensures that your flash-lit subject isn't over-exposed by a
flash burst that lasts too long.

## Balancing Act

The real point of talking about all of this is to figure out how to
balance ambient light with the light from your flash. The moral of the
story is that the shutter speed has an effect on the ambient light
_only_, while the aperture has an effect on both. It's not a _walk in
the park_ to get precisely the results you want without plenty of
in-the-field experience, but knowing that simple rule is a pretty good
start!

A very straightforward approach would be to set your shutter speed to
the slowest you feel comfortable with (if you're shooting hand-held,
that is your [main
limitation](/articles/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/))
and then adjust your aperture to where your subject is getting the light
from the flash that you desire (by chimping on your LCD using the
[histogram
display](/articles/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/,)
of course... Right?). Then you can start to ramp up the shutter speed to
see how it affects the ambient lighting (because it won't affect the
exposure of your subject if it is lit solely with the flash).

In the cases where ambient and flash light mixes on your subject, you're
going to need a lot more time to chimp the histogram.

[This article on
photonotes.org](http://photonotes).org/articles/eos-flash/ was invaluable
to me in learning about how flash works in the Canon EOS system. If you
shoot Canon, you should read this from top to bottom!
