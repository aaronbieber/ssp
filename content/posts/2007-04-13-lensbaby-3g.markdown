Today I received my brand new [Lensbaby](http://www.lensbabies.com/) 3G
from [B&H](http://www.bhphoto.com/). I've been looking forward to buying
one of these ever since the first version came out, but I'm very glad
that I waited for the third iteration because the new features it has
are (in my mind) indispensable.

I set up a very small tabletop studio rig yesterday, so I used it to
explore the Lensbaby and see what it could do. It's really a very nice
piece of equipment with solid build quality, but make no mistake: it's
*not easy* to use. Having no functional autofocus means paying a lot
more attention to the perceived focus and the way the bellows is
manipulated takes getting used to. People without a fair amount of
dexterity may become very frustrated with it.

Anyway, without further ado, here are a few samples.
