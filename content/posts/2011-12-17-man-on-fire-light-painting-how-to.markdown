!["Man on Fire"](/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-17-at-10.png ""Man on Fire"")

Dennis Calvert shares a really neat light painting technique on his blog
that he calls "Man on Fire." It basically involves creating a darkened
silhouette by firing a remote flash behind a subject to overexpose the
background behind them, and then "painting" in the silhouetted area with
some neat little light wands.

I'm sure you could do this with subjects other than people and with
light wands other than the ones Dennis uses. The result, I think, is
pretty spectacular. Because the background is blown out, bits of light
trail that go outside of the silhouette area become wispy and look very
cool.

Believe it or not, the image is straight out of the camera, no
post-processing or alterations at all.

Go check out the whole article
[on Dennis's blog](http://denniscalvert.net/blog/?p=118#comment-16) where you
will also find a time-lapse video of the making of the image, which is pretty
neat in its own right.
