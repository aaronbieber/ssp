    I'm in the midst of applying to graduate school (MFA painting/printmaking) right now and the hardest obstacle I've been dealing with (besides preparing my portfolio) is writing a coherent artist statement that's amazing and easy to understand but elegant enough to get others to like it.

    I googled "Writing a kick ass artist statement" and your website came up first.  I think the words "kick ass" made it easily searchable!  Thank you for the information you've supplied and your photography (especially the prison and Big Sur ones) are amazing!

What's that, you don't have an artist's statement? How do you expect
people to understand all of your pretentious goals if you don't write an
indecipherable, abstract, and self-involved narrative about them?

Okay, I'm mostly kidding. Seriously, though, writing an artist's
statement is important--sometimes even necessary--if you are going to
show your work in a gallery. On top of that, it can also be a great
exercise for your own self-exploration; sometimes being forced to put
your motivations into words can help you to focus yourself creatively.

Read the rest of the article for tips on writing your own kick-ass
artist's statement!~~MORE~~

I was reading this article by guest author Chris Folsom on Digital
Photography School about how to write an artist's statement (you can
[read the article
here](http://digital-photography-school.com/6-tips-for-writing-an-artist%E2%80%99s-statement))
and while I agreed with a lot of what Folsom said, I thought I could add
more to it.

If you don't have a lot of experience with writing, it can seem
intimidating or challenging to write about yourself and your work. Don't
worry, few people will likely read it since artist's statements are
typically self-aggrandizing rubbish. Alright, I'm kidding. Mostly.

The following tips will help you write an artist's statement that
*everyone* will want to read.

## Focus on the Work

In his article, Folsom says "share your background and history." I would
actually be somewhat more specific and suggest that you share things
about your background that inform your art. That is to say, just because
you enjoy kayaking in the summer and long walks on the beach doesn't
mean you should share it in your statement. On the other hand, if you
grew up in a rough neighborhood in Queens and that's why you like to
make images of people struggling in urban landscapes, that's absolutely
relevant.

A person who is reading an artist's statement at their gallery show is
interested more in what the work is trying to say or what motivated the
artist to create it. Stay on topic and don't turn your artist's
statement into an autobiography. If lots of people are interested in
your personal history, you can always print out a separate
autobiographical page that people can take, or post it on your website
for them to read.

## Don't Get Too Technical

I absolutely agree with Folsom on this point. In the case of at least
90% of photography, the technical details of its creation is not
relevant to a viewer. Only if you are doing something truly new,
remarkable, or different should technical details enter into your
artist's statement. Again, all of this extraneous information can be
posted on your own website or offered to interested parties in other
ways, keep it out of your statement.

If your work revolves around the process of its creation, you are the
exception to the rule and your artist's statement will likely be
technology-centric as well. If this is the case, you already know. If
you have to ask, then keep the details about your 5D Mark II and your
awesome lenses out of the statement.

## You're Not Selling Anything

Even if you're physically _selling_ the photographs in the show, and
even if this statement is meant to hang _in a store_, don't turn your
artist's statement into a pitch. Folsom writes, as a tip, "What would
you like someone else to say of this work?" That's crap. Don't write
what you want someone else to say, or what you think someone else might
say about it, or what you would ideally imagine another person's
perception of your work to be.

This is _your_ artist's statement. This is a place for you to explore
your intentions, expose your motivations, and to engage your viewers in
a little slice of the reality that you have captured using the art of
the written word rather than your camera. It is, and should be, as much
a part of you as your photographs are. Don't taint your artist's
statement by phrasing things like a viewer-friendly product description,
or pitching people on how well your work would look hanging in their
dining room. That's not an artist's statement, that's a sales
presentation.

On the other hand, if you take photographs specifically so they will
look good hanging in people's living rooms, maybe you should be selling
them at IKEA. Why are you writing an artist's statement in the first
place?

## Modesty Is the Best Policy

Although a gallery show (especially a single-artist show)--and an
artist's statement by extension--is a fundamentally egotistical
endeavor, that doesn't mean that you should be honking your own horn
left and right in your artist's statement. People have decided to view
your show and to read your statement, which is flattering on its face;
you should be shedding light on mysteries of your process, your ideas,
your motivations. Leave the self-promoting accolades for another time.

## My Artist's Statement

To give you some idea of what I'm trying to get at, why not read my own
artist's statement. Or not. This is the last section, so if you stop
reading now my feelings won't be hurt, I promise.

> "We know that behind every image revealed there is another image more
> faithful to reality, and in the back of that image there is another,
> and yet another behind the last one, and so on, up to the true image
> of that absolute, mysterious reality that no one will ever see."
> --Michelangelo Antonioni, "Beyond the Clouds" (1995)
>
> Because reality can never be truly captured--or even in some cases
> _perceived_--one is left to wonder "what good is reality?" In fine
> art photography, as in theatre, sculpture, painting, and the rest, the
> goal was never to _reproduce_ reality; it was never the goal to
> re-create that which already _is_, but instead to augment it, to
> bend it, to create a window through which the world could view one
> person's individual reality, their unique experience. Even as iconic
> sculpture such as Michelangelo's David approaches absolute realism,
> still there is an element of the artist in every shape and an
> experience not to be had from one's own perceptions.
>
> Fine art photography suffers from the misconception that it is
> _fundamentally_ a documentary technique; that art photography is
> nothing more than a creative twist on a technology invented to record
> a concrete reality as it would appear to the naked eye. I recognize
> that there is a grain of truth in those words--photographs are taken
> for documentary purposes every day--however, as a fine art
> photographer, I work to disabuse the world of the notion that
> photography is limited to such representational utility by opening a
> window through which _my_ individual reality can be seen.
>
> In each photograph I make, it is my ultimate objective to form an
> image that could not be seen without the use of a camera, to stretch
> and bend a slice of recorded reality into something more.

If, after reading that, your perception of [my
photography](http://gallery.aaronbieber.com) is not in some way
_enhanced_, then I have failed.
