I know that I'm like a broken record when I talk about B&H, always
rambling on and on about their impressive mid-town Manhattan superstore
and how great their customer service is, how I've always felt like I was
treated well by their floor staff and telephone sales folks, but you
know I wouldn't say any of these things if they weren't true. B&H is the
kind of company that _inspires_ flattery because you just want
everyone else to know how great they are.

On top of all that, their prices are always fair, and they make no
exception with software. You've probably heard me babble on more than
one occasion about how awesome Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is and how it
changed my photography from the moment I tried the early beta versions.
I've purchased every upgrade to Lightroom since version 1 and it still
kicks ass. Anyway, getting back to the point, B&H is having a little
promotion where you can get \$100 off a copy of Lightroom when you buy
practically any camera from them, including point-and-shoots.

If you haven't tried Lightroom yet, try it. You can [download a free
trial right now](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/) if
you want to give it a spin. When you decide you want to own it, just
click the attractive banner below to see the list of products that get
you the discount and click the "Buy Together & Save" link below your
choice.

Buy a new pocket-size Canon PowerShot for your
girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband and get \$100 off Lightroom for
yourself! That's what I would do at least.

[Buy something in this list and get \$100 off Lightroom 3.0!
