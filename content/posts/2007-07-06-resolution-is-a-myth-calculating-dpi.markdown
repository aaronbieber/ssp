    Great article.  I love the miles-per-hour analogy - I've never heard it put so well!

    These days, I print mostly from Lightroom rather than Photoshop.  And your article made me wonder, does Lightroom perform resampling?  Or is it disabled by default?  I suspect the latter but it would be nice to know for certain.

    Thanks, Chris! I haven't confirmed this personally, but one of the published features of Lightroom 1.1 is the ability to turn resampling on and off within the Print module, so that may answer your question.

    The minimal amount of printing I have done from Lightroom has always produced very nice results so I try not to worry about it too much.

    Agreed, the miles-per-hour analogy is perfect for explaining DPI.

    Wish I had this article years ago, when I was first learning about printing and resolution. Thanks Aaron! :)

    Resolution Is a Myth: Calculating DPI...

    Resolution can be hard to understand at first, and even experienced photographers can have trouble with it. BUT NOT FOR LONG!...

  content: "Your point of view regarding resolution makes a lot of sense when you
    are considering what dpi to send to a printer, but only as long as your source
    image is larger than the resolution of the printer.\r\n\r\nLets disregard poor
    photography, thus assuming an equal level of photographic data as a ratio of the
    number of pixels contained in the image.  Yes you can upscale an image to a larger
    relative \"resolution\", but you aren't gaining any additional source data and
    are thus not increasing the actual resolution of the image.\r\n\r\nA source image
    with a certain resolution can be used in certain printing applications based on
    the final resolution desired in the print.  Economies of scale do come into play
    as your viewing distance increases, but when discussing home printing, the difference
    in viewing distance between an 8x10 and and a 16x20 is not necessarily any different.
    \ If the printer can print either of these two sizes at 300 dpi max and your source
    image is only 8x10x300, you aren't going to be able to utilize the full printing
    resolution for the 16x20 print, producing a less defined image at the same viewing
    distance.\r\n\r\nThe point that I'm trying to get at is digital images do have
    an inherent resolution, and it relates to the source data.  Just because you can
    scale a digital image to other resolutions doesn't mean that the amount of data
    contained is not still directly related to the source resolution."

    @sucellus

    Thanks for your reply. You raise interesting points, but I maintain that images don't have an inherent _resolution_. What they do have is an inherent _pixel dimension_, or if you want to state it very simply, _pixel count_. As soon as that pixel count is applied to a measured area in physical space, it implies a resolution, but that resolution will vary based on the dimensions of the area.

    In other words, you can't take an image off of your memory card, look at it in some program, and say "this is a 182.3 DPI image," because there are no inches involved yet. You can tell Photoshop that you wish for it to be displayed at 182.3 DPI and it will alter its rulers to demonstrate how big it will be on paper, but that is all theory; it's all math.

    You're absolutely right that an image that measures 8x10 inches at 300 DPI, assuming your printer's maximum resolution is 300 DPI, can't be printed at 16x20 with full detail, but you may achieve enough detail to satisfy your needs. That's a judgment call as far as I'm concerned; I have worked with banner printers who state 150 DPI as their absolute maximum and standing in front of it you'd never know. It depends on the application and on the artist's needs.

    IS the image's resolution, and DPI is just a physical expression of that.  You
    are looking at the idea of digital images from the physical world perspective

    My contention is that the semantics of pixel count and resolution is the source of confusion among the uninitiated. Once you start working on print production, one's idea of what resolution means can become a big stumbling block. Using the word "resolution" to refer to the number of pixels present in a digital file (as it often is) can be very misleading when it actually describes a ratio that exists only in physical space.

    Thanks for commenting; I like having many points of view represented!

{% random right %}

Many people ask me, "What's the best resolution?" Not only is the most
important part of that question _missing_ (best resolution _for
what_?) but it's marinaded in thick and juicy misconceptions about what
_resolution_ really means.

Resolution is a myth.~~MORE~~

The word "resolution" itself refers to the clarity of an image; to the
detail visible in it. Technologically speaking, clarity is measured by
counting the number of distinct image components present within a
physical area. That doesn't sound mythological, I know, it sounds pretty
concrete. Let me tell you why this is an elusive term.

Fundamentally, resolution is a lot like "speed." If your friend asked
you _What's the best speed for my car?_ you would probably laugh at
them. _Your car can go many speeds,_ you might reply. _Where do you
need to go and why?_ It's important to know where you're going before
you decide how fast you should go. Although there are guidelines for how
fast you probably should go in most places and situations, you can't
answer the question without more information. The same is true for
resolution.

Before I start explaining things, let me talk about units of
measurement. We've all heard of and probably used the _DPI_ unit when
talking about resolution. DPI means _dots per inch_ (see how it's sort
of like _miles per hour_?). As I mentioned at the beginning, you have
some distinct image components in there (the "dots") and they are within
a physical area ("per inch"). I will use DPI to measure resolution
throughout this article because it's familiar and ubiquitous.

Digital images are automatically made up of _dots_ that we call
"pixels." Somewhere in between the image sensor of your camera and the
RAW or JPEG file on your computer, software (probably in your camera)
divided the image up into a uniform grid of pixels. So what's the
resolution of a digital image? _It doesn't have one_.

In order for something to have a concrete _resolution_, it needs a
physical area. Digital images floating around in the ether don't have
physical area, they only have dots, so they have no resolution. Before
you explode and tell me I'm a buffoon, let me explain.

Fundamentally, resolution is a way to understand how the number of dots
available in your image will appear in any physical scenario, most
importantly in print. It is not correct to think that an image has an
_inherent_ resolution, just like your friend's car doesn't have an
_inherent_ speed.

Photoshop gives you a place to set the resolution in the Image Size
dialog. As long as you don't tell Photoshop to "resample" the image,
changing the resolution number there won't change your image in the
slightest; it simply annotates the file as if to say "please display
measurements with the assumption that this many dots are in each inch."

By the way, it's usually not a good idea to use the "resample" option
unless you're _decreasing_ the resolution.

## Totally Confused?

Resolution is not easy to explain or to understand without experience,
so I'm going to give you a hypothetical scenario. Watch out, there will
be some _light arithmetic_!

![](/articles/Resolution/Figure-1.gif)

As shown in the figure above, let's assume we have an image that is
exactly ten pixels by ten pixels (this makes math easier). The only
thing that "resolution" really tells us is the physical size of this
image in different scenarios.

When you set the resolution in Photoshop's Image Size dialog, you're
telling it to map pixel dimensions to physical dimensions in a certain
way (you math whiz kids might know it as a _ratio_). Because the
default unit is DPI, you're mapping pixel dimensions to physical
dimensions measured in inches.

For example, at one (1) DPI there is one _dot per inch_, so our ten
pixel square image takes up a space ten inches on each side. One pixel
(or _dot_) per inch. At two (2) DPI, it would be five inches on each
side. Divide the pixel dimension by the resolution in DPI to find the
dimension in inches. Ten divided by two equals five. (That's pretty
light arithmetic, right?)

## So What? Applying the Theory

How does this knowledge help us to make clear, crisp prints from our
images?

To begin, you need to know what the "optimal" print resolution is for
your situation. With inkjet technology, the optimal output resolution
might be given in your printer's manual. A good rule of thumb (in my
experience) is to send images between 150 and 300 DPI to the printer.
With other technologies, such as "lightjet," resolution requirements may
differ.

The resolution required to achieve your desired clarity decreases as the
physical size of the print (and therefore the proper viewing distance)
increases. If you stood with your face right up to a billboard print,
you could probably count the dots; prints designed to be viewed at
billboard distances do not require the same resolution as prints
designed to be viewed from a few feet away. This has to do with the
human eye and its ability to discern detail at varying distances.

The _best practice_ method of readying your image for print is to
adjust the print dimensions without letting Photoshop perform
_resampling_. You do this in the Image Size dialog by _disabling_
the "Resample Image" option and changing the values within the "Document
Size" area. You will notice that if you make the width or height larger,
the resolution will decrease, and vice versa.

The goal is to get the width and height close to what you want the
output size to be (on paper) while keeping the resolution somewhere in
the "safe zone" for sharpness (for me, somewhere between 150 and 300 or
higher).

## Conclusions

Hopefully this has given you a better idea of what resolution really is
and why it's fallacious to think that a digital image has any inherent
resolution. With practice, it becomes easier to recognize the instances
when resampling of the image is appropriate and how it affects your
printed output.
