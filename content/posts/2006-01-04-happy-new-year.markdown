So it's 2006 already. In a way it seems as though 2005 went by very
quickly. At the same time, *so much* happened. I got carried away and
forgot to post!

Here are just a couple of things. First, a picture I took for a friend
of mine as a Christmas present for a different friend. I did a
tremendous amount of Photoshop post-processing work on this. He loved
it.

And here is some other crap that was sitting on my memory card for
weeks.

Happy new year to one and all!
