It's been a while since I've posted, well, you know, _photographs_
here on my photo blog, but I think you'll agree it was worth the wait. I
spent a day in rainy Boston last weekend with my Lensbaby 3G,
introducing it to the charm of beantown. <!--more-->

This was the first time I took the Lensbaby out in the city and I am
very pleased with the results. It's extremely challenging to focus by
sight without a proper focusing screen, and being locked at f/2 probably
doesn't help either, but I wanted the most dramatic depth of field and
also the most flexibility in varying light conditions. I made several of
these shots by "bracketing focus," which is to say I would make several
exposures rapidly while very slightly moving the Lensbaby's front ring
toward and away from me in the range where it appeared to be in focus
through the viewfinder.

A few shots that I thought I nailed were completely blurry, and others
that I wasn't sure about came out very well, so that's a testament to
practice... Which I lack. Without further ado:
