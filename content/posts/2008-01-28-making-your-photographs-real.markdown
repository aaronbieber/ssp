It has been said that a photograph isn't truly _done_—that it doesn't completely
_exist_—until it has been printed.

Whether you believe printing to be the absolute culmination of your photographic
efforts or not, you will undoubtedly have an ongoing need to print your images
nonetheless, whether it be for presentation; to give as gifts; to make cards,
calendars, or other products; or to wallpaper your bathroom (snap a quick photo
of that if you do!)

Here are some services that may come to your aid.~~MORE~~

## Pro Printing

When I print my images for serious presentation, to frame and hang in my own
home, or to show elsewhere, I always turn
to [White House Custom Color][whcc]. Their prices are competitive and their
service is second-to-none. Once you've signed up for a _free_ account, they will
do two things:

[whcc]: http://www.whcc.com

* They will send you samples of their papers and finishes (of which they have
  several traditional and a few eclectic choices), and

* They will allow you to upload a few images to make _free test prints_, which
  they will send to you _completely free of charge_.

If there is anyone else out there who is more eager to have your
business, I don't know who they are. On top of all that, they also offer
ICC color profiles to download so you can "soft proof" your images for
their specific equipment, making it even easier to achieve the results
you need.

## Consumer Printing

If you are less concerned with quality and more concerned with
_value_, there is a neat site that will allow you to compare price
points and user reviews of more photo printing sites than you can shake
a stick at (nearly 50 when I looked). It's called
[printRates](http://www.printrates.com/), and according to their site,
they aim to let you:

> Save money on digital photo printing by comparing digital photo printing
> prices and reading reviews. compare dozens of digital photo printing sites
> read and write reviews choose the right one for you.

Okay, so their grammar isn't perfect... Nevertheless, chances are they
have reviews of photo printing sites you've never heard of; who knows,
you might find the _diamond in the rough_.
