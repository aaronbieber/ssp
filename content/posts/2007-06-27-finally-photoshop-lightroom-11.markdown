![Photoshop Lightroom 1.1](/articles/images/lightroom.jpg)

Adobe has finally released the first upgrade package for Photoshop
Lightroom, which brings us to version 1.1. I say "finally" because this
upgrade introduces at least one feature that we hoped against hope would
be in the first release, the ability to _merge libraries_, among other
enhancements.

First, if you have Lightroom and it hasn't already popped up and told
you to [download the
upgrade](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom), you should
seriously click over there and do that.~~MORE~~

When I went out to [Yosemite National
Park](http://www.fisheyegallery.com/Places/Yosemite) and [Santa
Cruz](http://www.fisheyegallery.com/Places/SantaCruz), I brought my
laptop with Lightroom on it. Because my home Lightroom library (now
called a catalog in v1.1 and also in the rest of this post) is tied to
photos saved in certain places on my home network and also because it's
gigantic, I started a fresh new catalog on my laptop. It was great to be
able to use Lightroom to import the RAW files, do some work on them, see
which ones were going to work out, even edit a few to completion while
on the road.

However, upon returning home, I had two Lightroom catalogs. Lightroom
has always supported switching between catalogs, which is nice, but
never _merging_ them. That feature was supposed to have been in the
1.0 release, but the developers decided it wasn't up to snuff, so they
nixed it until it was more fleshed out. I was very excited to see the
new options available in version 1.1 for importing photos from one
catalog into another, satisfying my every desire. Last night I imported
all of my Yosemite and Santa Cruz photos into my primary catalog, which
took a good ten minutes to process on my older G4, but I now have a
nice, solid, unified catalog.

As a workflow tool, it's excellent to be able to create a new catalog
on, say, your laptop, take it where you're going, do what you need to
do, and then be able to merge that into your home catalog when you
return. Did I mention that the "import from another catalog" feature
imports only the photos you select and puts them where you want them (or
leaves them where they are), just like importing from anywhere else?
They thought of everything.

There are a variety of other new features, including a _really slick_
"spray can" tool (replacing the rubber stamp) within the Library module
that allows you to "spray" photos with keywords, ratings, flags, labels,
develop presets, metadata presets, or rotations. As soon as I saw it I
actually giggled a little bit. Out loud. I'm a huge nerd.

To see what else is new and review known issues, read the [Lightroom 1.1
