The faltering economy has claimed the life of another small business
today. I received an e-mail from the Editor in Chief of [JPG
Magazine](http://jpgmag.com) announcing that on Monday they're shutting
their doors for good. I only got the e-mail because I have been a
registered member of the site for some time and although none of my
photos ever made it into the magazine it was always something I wanted
to be more serious about.

_I guess I missed the boat._

JPG Magazine was a publication, both electronic and print, entirely
supported by user submissions. JPG would suggest a series of "themes"
and users would submit images that they thought suited the subject.
Through a voting process, the best-liked images floated to the top and
got published in the magazine. It was a great way for any photographer
to get their name out and for the magazine to spread inspiration and
thus collect subscription fees.

I'm not sure what their exact business model was; I never subscribed to
the print magazine. Perhaps their philosophy was too open and too
philanthropic to extract the necessary payments from their members to
stay afloat. That's only conjecture.

Still, it's a shame to see such a wonderful resource go away. I could
spend hours browsing the published photos to find inspiration, and
inspiration I did regularly find there.

So now what?

You can go view the published photos on JPG Magazine's [published
photos](http://jpgmag.com/photos/published/) page until Monday (the 5th
of January), but after that, it will be gone.

[Download PDFs](http://www.jpgmag.com/downloads/archives).html of
previous JPG Magazine issues (also until Monday). That way you'll have
all of this great stuff right there on your hard drive.

If you're looking for inspiration, you can always browse [PhotoSIG's
highest rated photos](http://www.photosig.com/go/photos?sort=rating-d,)
which are basically mind-blowing 100% of the time.

Check out [The Unofficial JPG Magazine
Group](http://flickr.com/groups/jpgmag) on Flickr. There are lots of
awesome images there, too.

Of course you could always view [my
