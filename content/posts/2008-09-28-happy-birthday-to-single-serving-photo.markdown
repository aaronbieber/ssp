Believe it or not, it has been precisely *three years* since the [very
first post](/articles/2005/09/28/catch-up/) on
this blog. It started out as a place for me to post experimental photos
and has since evolved into a great platform for sharing the information
and inspiration that I come across all the time.

To all of you out there reading this now, thank you! I wouldn't write
all of these articles if nobody read them, and your occasional feedback
has been really great, whether praise or critique.

If any of you have fond memories to share or ideas for where you'd like
to see this blog go in the future, as always, your comments are more
than welcome. It's been a pretty great three years; stick around,
there's more to come.
