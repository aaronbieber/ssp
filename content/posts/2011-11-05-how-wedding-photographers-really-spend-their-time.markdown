Quite a few people out there seem to think that professional photography
is a life of glamour, excitement, and international travel. If you make
a living photographing, I don't need to tell you how false that
perception is. ~~MORE~~

This is how non-photographers (and perhaps even some casual hobbyist
photographers) think pros spend their time:

Meanwhile, according to the results of a survey completed by the
International Society of Wedding Photographers, this is how professional
photographers _actually_ spend their time:

These graphs and the results of the survey are from ISWP's article,
[The Secret Life of Wedding Photographers](http://www.ispwp.com/the-secret-life-of-wedding-photographers.html),
which I encourage you to read.

To go along with the above graphs, they also have some quotes from the
respondents of the survey related to their non-photography
responsibilities. For most independent professionals in the photography
industry, success hinges on being able to perform most of the duties of
an entire business, from strategic planning, marketing, billing, and
fulfillment to the photography itself.

And people ask me why I don't want to quit my job and photograph full
time...
