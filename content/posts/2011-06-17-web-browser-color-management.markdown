I've written articles in the past about color management--you know, ICC
profiles, calibration, metamerism, blah blah blah--but the world keeps
changing around us. In general, things change for the better, which is
great, but as a photographer looking to display images on the web, there
are always things to watch out for.

I found a great article on the burgeoning "Gear Oracle" site about web
browser color management, which breaks down the effects of displaying
images with different color spaces in different browsers.

It's not all great news, but it's important to know how things work so
that you can mitigate any potential problems. Color management is
basically a briar patch no matter how attentive and diligent you are,
and trust me, I know this from close personal experience printing
photographic reproductions for five years.
