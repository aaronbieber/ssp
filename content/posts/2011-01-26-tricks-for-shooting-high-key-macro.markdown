I just read a very cool article by Alex Koloskov over at AKELstudio's
"Atalanta Photographer Blog" about how he was able to get great macro
detail on a small medical brush with clear bristles when shooting on a
white background (for a catalog, I would guess).

Here's a little taste of what the final product looked like using his
techniques (this is a 100% crop of the final photo, click for the full

[Head over to Alex's
blog](http://www.akelstudio.com/blog/shooting-macro-on-a-white-background-simple-yet-very-useful-tricks/)
to see his lighting setup and read his tips on how to pull this off.
