  content: Well, actually I've read about this rule/guideline before, but I learned
    something new. That in my 30D I need to multiply the focal length of my lens (say,
    85mm) first by 1.6 and that's the minimum shutter speed at which I can safely
    handhold my camera to prevent blurring. Thanks!

  content: "@deuts,\r\n\r\nI'm glad that this was helpful for you! Just to clarify
    for the benefit of other readers, to find out what the multiplier is for your
    specific camera model, I find Digital Photography Review to be a great resource.
    Information about the 30D specifically was found on http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos30d/page2.asp
    under \"Lenses.\"\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep the multiplier in mind because
    cameras with cropped sensors such as deuts's 30D require a faster shutter speed
    to counteract hand shake than full-frame cameras. Happy shooting!"

    @tukangmoto,

    You're absolutely right, I completely forgot to mention that! I am going to amend the article to discuss Image Stabilization and Vibration Reduction. Thanks :)

  content: I have used the reciprocal rule for years. It works very well. Also keep
    in mind that mirror and shutter vibration will usually make a 28mm shot at 1/30
    somewhat shaky in the detail. I usually add 1 stop to the reciprocal formula.
    (e.g., shoot at a 1/60 for 28-50mm lenses).

  content: Thanks for your comment and advice, John. Remember also that if your 28-50mm
    lens is zoomed to 50mm, the reciprocal rule would suggest 1/60, so adding a stop
    would bring you to 1/125.

In one of my previous posts I mentioned the "focal length reciprocal rule" and
it occurred to me that not all of my readers may know what that is. Rather than
find someone else's article about it (of which I'm sure there are many) and link
to it, I thought I'd just write my own.

The goal of the rule (which is more of a guideline than a rule, actually) is to
give you an idea of whether a photograph will come out blurry if you're holding
the camera in your hand. It is a somewhat simple formula to determine how
various camera settings combine to compensate for camera shake. I use the rule
constantly while I'm out shooting because I don't like to bring a tripod to most
places and there's no use bringing home a whole CF card filled with blurry
photographs.

Not only will I explain what this reciprocal rule is, but I'll give you real
examples of how to use it in the field.~~MORE~~

## The Reciprocal Rule

In its simplest terms, the rule states that you can safely handhold the camera
if your shutter speed is faster than the reciprocal of your effective focal
length. That may sound slightly daunting--and I guess that's why people write
articles about it--but it's not a very hard thing to figure out in your head
once you get the hang of it.

So first of all, what is a reciprocal? Everyone probably learned this in high
school math, but as I was always quick to point out right before exams, _who
uses that stuff, anyway?_ A reciprocal is what you get when you flip a fraction
upside down. Because every whole number is a fraction made up of itself over one
(3 is the same as 3/1), the reciprocal of a whole number is one over that
number. For example, the reciprocal of 60 is 1/60.

Before I get further into the _math_, let me start by explaining how I use the
reciprocal rule. My preference is to stay in `Av` or Aperture Value mode
basically all the time, so I choose an aperture and my camera will meter the
scene and tell me what shutter speed it thinks I should be using to get a proper
exposure. By manipulating my ISO sensitivity, aperture setting, and `EV`
(Exposure Value), I can cause the metered shutter speed to become faster or
slower.

The goal (while using this rule) is to manipulate the values you have control
over until the shutter speed is _faster_ than the reciprocal of your focal
length. When figuring out your focal length remember these important caveats:

* If you are using a zoom lens, your focal length depends on how far you are
  _zoomed in_. With a 24-70mm lens for example, your focal length could be
  anywhere between 24mm and 70mm. You can generally use the markings on the
  barrel of the lens to ballpark the current focal length; it doesn't have to be
  perfect. If you want to round it to the nearest actual marking, round _up_ to
  be safe.

* If you are using a digital camera with a sensor smaller than full-frame
  (e.g. APS-C, etc.), which includes the Canon 10D, 20D, 30D, all of the Rebels,
  all Nikons, and basically every point-and-shoot camera _on planet Earth_, you
  need to multiply the current focal length of your lens by your camera's
  _multiplier_ to get the true effective focal length. As an example, the 10D
  has a 1.6x multiplier, so a 24mm lens on the 10D has an effective focal length
  of 24mm x 1.6 = 38.4mm. If you don't know what your camera's multiplier is,
  consult the manual, [Digital Photography Review](http://www.dpreview.com), or
  search [Google](http://www.google.com).

I know I just made this "easy" guideline sound even more complicated, but as I
mentioned before, it's just a guideline. It might be easier to multiply by 1.5
and then just assume the answer is too slow by one stop, or take your best
guess. There is no substitute for experience in this case.

## Example

Here is a "real-world" example that will show you how the numbers are put
together to give you an answer. I simulated these settings with my camera, so
you can be sure that they're pretty close, but as always, YMMV (Your Mileage
May Vary).

I am working with my 50mm f/1.4 lens on the 5D (which is full-frame), so my
effective focal length is always 50mm. That should make it a bit easier to
explain.

Using *Av*, or *Aperture Value* mode, I set my aperture to *f/1.4*. My ISO is
*100*. I meter the scene and the camera tells me I need a shutter speed of *1/8
second* to get the proper exposure.  *1/8* is much larger than the reciprocal of
my focal length (which is *1/50*, right?) so I need a faster shutter speed.

Opening the aperture would give me more light, but it's already as far open as
it can go. I have two choices:

* Add more light to the scene.
* Increase my ISO sensitivity.

In most cases it's not possible to add more light to the scene when you're
shooting in the field, so my only choice is to increase the ISO sensitivity. I
set it to *800*. Again I meter the scene. Now my camera tells me I need a
shutter speed of *1/60*. 1/60 is faster than 1/50, so according to the
reciprocal rule, it should be OK to expose this photo.

Bear in mind the following caveats:

* If your subject is *moving*, the reciprocal rule doesn't help you too
  much. While it does give a pretty good estimate of the shutter speed necessary
  to counteract the shake of your hands while holding the camera, it doesn't
  tell you anything about the shutter speed necessary to freeze any given moving
  subject.

* People with a lot of dexterity have been able to take incredibly crisp images
  of moving subjects at long focal lengths without tripods simply because they
  are like photographic snipers. I've never had good luck with that.

## Image Stabilization (IS) and Vibration Reduction (VR)

Thanks to [tukangmoto](http://tukangmoto.wordpress.com/) for reminding me about
these features!

The two major camera manufacturers, Canon and Nikon, produce lenses with
technology designed to help you with the specific problem of camera
shake, which they call IS and VR, respectively. Other camera
manufacturers, such as Olympus, Minolta, and Sony, have built this
feature into their camera bodies as well.

I don't know the specifics of the system outside of the Canon world, but Canon
claims that using one of their IS lenses will allow your shutter speed to be
*two stops* slower than this rule would tell you. When we say "stops," we
basically mean two notches down on your camera's scale.  With their latest
generation IS, Canon claims that *three stops* should be possible, but as
always, it's better to play it safe, especially when using this rule, because
it's an estimate.

If you are using an IS- or VR-equipped camera or lens (with that feature turned
on, of course!), you should be safe to achieve a shutter speed one stop slower
than the rule tells you to. In other words, if the rule estimates 1/125th is
fast enough, you can probably get by at 1/60th (each full stop in the shutter
scale is about half as long or twice as long, depending on which direction
you're moving in; see the
[Tedious Explanation of the f/stop](http://www.uscoles.com/fstop.htm).)

If you liked this article or have suggestions that might make it easier to
understand, leave a comment! Happy shooting.
