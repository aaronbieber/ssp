![Johnny Five
Alive!!](/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/johnny-five-259x300.jpg "Johnny Five")

It goes without saying that people are endeared to robots. Why, just
look at that lovable Johnny Five over there, _the_ late-'80s childhood
icon of the human/robot emotional connection. And why not? Robots are
built to serve us unswervingly and to carry out our commands without a
microsecond's hesitation.

Will and Matt Burrard-Lucas love photography, but they, too, love
robots. Okay, I'm using "robot" in a very loose sense here, because what
they have builtâ€”they call it the BeetleCamâ€”is more of an RC car than
a robot, but let's not split hairs... It's awesome anyway!

These two guys wanted to photograph African wildlife in a way that
hadn't been done before, and without putting themselves in mortal danger
(aye, there's the rub), so they built, from scratch, a remote-controlled
Canon EOS-400D! Then they booked a two-week safari in Tanzania and made
some fantastic photographs.

Here is the teaser video:
