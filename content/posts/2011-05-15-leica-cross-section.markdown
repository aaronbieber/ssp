I'm sitting on a bunch of material that I will eventually develop into
full articles, but in the meantime, feast your eyes on this exquisitely
detailed cross-section of a Leica lens. Just in case you were curious
why these things are so expensive...

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/leica.jpg "Leica Cross-Section")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/leica.jpg)

After careful inspection, I can confidently say that these are two
photos of the same half of the lens from either side. I have no idea why
someone would have one half of a lens and not the other half, perhaps it
was just a demonstration piece. I count seven elements, but I'm really
not an expert. It looks like the lens has a maximum focal length of
22mm.

Any Leica folks out there who can fill in some blanks? Leave a comment!

*Edit*: I just learned that this split lens was the result of some
kind of educational final project. The [engadget
post](http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/16/4-000-leica-lens-split-in-two-sold-on-ebay-as-1-000-piece-of/)
this information comes from says that "Leica students" were permitted to
cut a \$4,500 lens in half as an art project. I'm not sure what a "Leica
student" is, but the halves sold on eBay for almost \$1,000.

So I guess if you cut a Leica lens in half, you cut its value in
quarters. Or something. Still, a very cool view into the complexity of
these instruments that we use all the time.
