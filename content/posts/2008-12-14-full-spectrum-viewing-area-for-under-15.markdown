How many times have you held up one of your photographic prints in the light of
day---actual, real day---and thought _That's not at all what I bargained for_?
Never? Well that's good. You must be one of the lucky ones, or one of the blind
ones.

Even with the best equipment that money can buy, ICC profiles,
spectrophotometers, an iron-clad color management workflow, and a high-end
monitor, your eyes are the ultimate judges of your work. But eyes, they don't
work alone; you can't see anything without light, and the quality of the light
will have as much an effect on what you see as the color of the print itself.

I got onto this topic after reading Michael Johnston's overview of
his [Viewing Station][vs].  All these years I've been experimenting with lights
in my studio space, let's call it Single-Serving Photo HQ---or, as my friends
call it, my bedroom---and I never once thought to write about it.

After the jump I'll tell you how to *dramatically increase your viewing
conditions for about $15*. ~~MORE~~

Michael says he uses one of those clip-on Verilux full-spectrum fluorescent
setups. When I started down this path, I hadn't heard of Verilux specifically,
but I was sure I wanted to go fluorescent after being turned off by these
so-called "daylight" incandescent bulbs that were nothing more than regular
bulbs with bluish glass designed to offset the orange light they actually
generate. Michael's entire lamp, which includes the bulb, cost him around
\$80. We can do better than that.

## Get a Bulb

I wound up sampling several compact fluorescent bulbs from
[1000bulbs.com](http://clickserve.cc-dt.com/link/click?lid=41000000027242453)
and eventually decided upon a
[100 watt equivalent 5100k](http://clickserve.cc-dt.com/link/click?lid=41000000027242501)
model. Here's a picture of what it looks like, sort of:

There are perhaps four important considerations when looking at bulbs
for your viewing environment.

* Wattage (or equivalent wattage, when talking about fluorescent)---I like my
  viewing conditions to be fairly bright, so I went with 100 watt equivalent,
  but you may prefer to go higher or lower.

* Spectrum---Get a bulb that is classified as "full-spectrum," meaning that it
  doesn't purposefully exclude certain wavelengths.

* Color temperature---Anything from 5,000K and up should do fine. I prefer
  5,100K, you might go as high as 5,400K.

* Color Rendering Index (CRI)---This method of measuring the color accuracy of a
  light source has its flaws, but it's better than guessing; a higher number is
  better, 100 is perfect.

## A Note About CRI

The Color Rendering Index (CRI) is a measure of a light source's ability to
reproduce color. Those of you mathematically inclined or simply curious
can [read about it on Wikipedia][cri]. This particular system has its
detractors, but it's the system most widely used at the moment, and
1000bulbs.com lists the CRI value for most of its bulbs, especially the ones
billed as "full-spectrum."

The Verilux bulbs that you find in systems such as Michael's rate around 86 and
up on the CRI scale. The bulb I chose scores an 82, which by all accounts should
be good enough for any normal person. Some halogen bulbs are rated 100, which is
as accurate as a light source can be on that scale, but halogen is expensive,
hot, and may be too bright for some people.

23 Watt, full-spectrum, 5100K CFL from 1000bulbs.com: *$5.71*

## Get a Lamp

What good is a bulb without a lamp to screw it into? Perhaps you have a spare
lamp somewhere in your house that you can use, but if you don't, do not
despair. I went down to the home improvement store and picked up a simple work
light (sometimes also called a painter's light or a clip
light). [Here is a pretty basic one][worklight] offered at Lowe's; I don't
remember where I got mine.

Simple clip-on work light: *$7.48*

Clip it onto something, such as your apartment's fashionably painted structural
beams, and away you go!

I actually bought three bulbs, three work lights, and plugged them all into a
single power strip so I can turn them on and off with one switch and light my
whole computer area. It's very helpful to be able to lay prints out on top of
the printer or on my desk and have the same quality of light everywhere.

You will definitely see a difference in the appearance of your prints as you
move them from one light source to another. Nearly every print will have some
variation in the way it reacts to light. Some inkjet inks are known to be rather
more prone to this change in appearance (which is
called [metamerism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color))), such as
Epson K2 (the inks I use). It's not necessarily a bad thing, but as an artist
you need to be aware of the possible ways in which your work will be viewed and
whether you are satisfied with the work's performance.

So there you go. A full-spectrum viewing solution for *less than $15*.
