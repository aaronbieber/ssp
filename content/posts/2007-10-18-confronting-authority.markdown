As part of my contribution to [Blog Action
Day](http://blogactionday.com), I posted a story about [being confronted
by a park
ranger](/articles/2007/10/16/protecting-our-national-parks-one-photographers-story/)
while photographing using flashlights in the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park.

Although I believe the ranger overstepped his bounds and acted with
undue suspicion under the circumstances, [my
colleague](http://www.curiouslens.com) and I reacted--in my opinion--in a
completely appropriate way. We were very polite and understanding of the
issues at hand and we recognized that Tennessee might do things a little
bit differently than Connecticut. For example, in Tennessee,
_photographers get frisked under suspicion of poaching_.

Anyway, it's a good idea to hold up your end of the bargain if you do
get approached by an _officer of the law_, and to act in a way that
reflects positively on yourself and on all of us as photographers.
Especially if there is a video camera in the officer's car...

Yesterday, I ran across this article, [5 Things Photographers Should Do
When Confronted By
Police](http://www.photographybay.com/2007/05/16/5-things-photographers-should-do-when-confronted-by-police/.)
It contains some helpful tips and might be useful to you in your
travels.

It's also a good idea to know your rights in these situations, and to
help you I will once again point you toward Andrew Kantor's [Legal
Rights of
Photographers](http://www.kantor.com/useful/Legal-Rights-of-Photographers.pdf)
(pdf) ((Linked with permission. If that copy is down, [get it from
me](http://www.singleservingphoto.com/articles/docs/Legal-Rights-of-Photographers.pdf)
)) guide, a somewhat abridged yet very straightforward and
understandable overview of your rights as a photographer (at least in
the United States).

For a _slightly_ more technical view, you may wish to read [The
Photographer's Right](http://www.krages.com/phoright).htm by Bert P.
Krages II (attorney at law). Although no advice given by an attorney
from outside of _your_ state could be said to be _formal_, anyone
out there from Oregon just struck gold. For those of us who aren't from
_the pacific wonderland_, at least you can say that this advice was
cobbled together by someone with actual legal training.

-If you want to dive in _yet further_, please do visit the forums at
PhotoPermit.org where you can read all about your rights, current
events, and first-hand accounts of being hassled or confronted by
authority figures both _various_ and _sundry_.- \[Edit: Apparently
photopermit.org has now been replaced by a spam site. Condolences.\]
