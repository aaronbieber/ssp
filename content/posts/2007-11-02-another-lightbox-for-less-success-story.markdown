    A highly enterprising venture. Glad to see you mention the danger of fire with home made studio setups. I'm always fascinated by how ingenious photographers are in coming up with lighting solutions. A friend who photographs diamonds for De Beers uses a Metz flash and walks around the stone using multiple flashes to light all facets of the stone. His perfect diamond lighting has other pros scratching their heads in wonder LOL.

    Bookmarking your blog.

    All the best,
    Paul

  content: To avoid flaming disasters, I use compact fluorescent floodlamps in painters'
    lamps. For anything needing lots and lots of light, I use a pair of 65W compact
    fluorescent lamps I picked up at Costco. They're designed for lighting driveways
    or such, and are 500W equivalent. I find the light balance much easier to correct
    for than incandescent, and I have far fewer flames.

    Thanks for the tip, Paul!

    I browsed around my favorite online retailer, [1,000 Bulbs](http://www.1000bulbs.com), and found that they now make cold cathode dimmable lamps for standard sockets as well, which use even less power and run even cooler than standard fluorescents! You can't get them as bright as 500 watt equivalent (yet), but they could be a nice option for some.

If you have, let's just say, a trunk-full of _strange and wondrous
objects_ fresh off the barge and out of the splintered shipping crate
from lands afar, chances are good you're either the kingpin of an
international smuggling ring or you're going into business for yourself.
If you're my friend Eli, you're the owner and operator of _Old Man
Hodapp's Worldly Treasures_, peddling only the finest of... Completely
weird stuff from all over the globe.

After you've come to terms with the concept of selling parts of animals
you can't readily identify, you will surely need to take some pretty
pictures to entice the prospective customers who crawl through your
website, and that means you're going to want to build a low-cost
lightbox (or cloudbox or cloud dome or... _diffuse light chamber_) to
get that snappy catalog look.

I got together with Eli and got him to explain how he constructed a very
serviceable lightbox for _less than \$20_. We also talked a bit about
post-processing and how to streamline the task of readying hundreds of
product shots for the web without going insane.~~MORE~~

A couple of weeks ago, Eli called me up and told me that he wanted to
make his product photos look more like what Apple does on their website,
meaning high-key, pure white backgrounds, no corners or distractions,
just very _fresh_. My advice was to either use a [cloud
dome](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/279145-REG/Cloud_Dome_CDGPKIT_Cloud_Dome_Pro_Kit.html)
(which can get a little pricey), or to build [some sort
of](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2007/03/on-assignment-flavored-vodkas.html)
[inventive](http://www.pbase.com/wlhuber/light_box_light_tent) [DIY
lightbox](http://www.ourmedia.org/node/253481.)

It seems like the Internet is simply [crawling with DIY lightbox
articles](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=diy+lightbox&btnG=Search,)
but in my opinion, the more the merrier! Eli decided to go the DIY
lightbox route and immediately purchased some of the most common
supplies used:

* 2-3 sheets of 30x40" foamcore (or foam board or foamboard) from the
crafts store, \$2 per sheet.
 * 1 painter's lamp (the kind you can clip to things), about \$3.
 * 1 utility lamp (the kind with a handle a cage over the bulb), \$2.50
or so.
 * A few sheets of thick, white paper... \$1 million. Er, no, \$1.
 * Baking parchment (that's right). \$2.

Construction of the box is as simple as cutting and taping the foamcore
to create a five-sided chamber of the size you require for the objects
you're photographing. I don't think I need to draw up any _schematics_
here, but I will provide _pictures_.

And now a couple of close-ups.

Notice that Eli has used a thick sheet of white paper to create the
seamless backdrop by taping it part-way up the back wall of the box and
allowing it to drape down, leaving no hard edges to cast distracting
shadows.

Both light sources are diffused using a couple sheets of baking
parchment. Using baking parchment gives you some assurance that it won't
burst into flames during your shoot, quickly turning an entertaining
photo session into a run for dear life. The utility lamp on top of the
box shines through a hole cut in the foamcore and is concentrated by a
piece of aluminum foil above it.

As you can see here, the light is very well distributed and diffused,
creating a smooth and uniform backdrop for the object. You can probably
also tell that the tungsten bulbs, even with the camera set on tungsten
white balance, create a very creamy red--almost purple--shade. This is
easy to correct in Photoshop.

Here is a raw, uncorrected image straight from the camera.

Eli recorded a Photoshop action to apply a couple curves adjustments.
Because the light color and exposure are very consistent, it's possible
to use the same curves settings for every shot and stay pretty well on
the mark. The first step is to correct the white balance issue by
selecting the curves function and using the _white_ eye dropper tool
to select a part of the image that ought to be white.

The second adjustment Eli applies basically overexposes the image a bit
to bring the background paper up to pure white, blowing out any little
bits of dust or marks that are on the paper and creating more of an
ethereal look, a la Apple.

It's not perfect, but for under \$20 in supplies, it's pretty
impressive!

Once you have constructed your DIY lightbox, you have a source of soft,
consistent light that you can use in many applications. Eli purchased a
length of black velvet material at the craft store and was able to
convert his high-key lightbox into a low-key lightbox in just a couple
of minutes. Check it out:

Yeah, it's a _fox skull_. I told you he had some weird stuff! I mean,
if you ever wanted a big, shiny beetle (yes, it's real) sealed inside an
acrylic block that you could wave around in your friends' faces and make
them uncomfortable... You may want to visit [Old Man Hodapp's Worldly
Treasures](http://www.oldmanhodapp.com.)

Cool, right? If you have any questions for me or for Eli, we'd be glad
to answer them; just leave a comment!
