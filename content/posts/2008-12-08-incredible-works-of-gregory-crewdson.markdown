It's not every day you come across photography that is simply
_arresting_. Even in the realm of surrealism, so much is possible with
software these days that few photographic creations make you look twice
and wonder "How'd they do that?" Such was the effect that Gregory
Crewdson's work had on me when I first saw it.

His works are (from what I've seen, at least) untitled, which is a
subject for another article. I don't know how much post-processing goes
into these images, but I know that Crewdson is known for his elaborate
lighting setups, which leads me to believe there isn't much. He's
well-known enough to have [his own page on
Wikipedia,](http://en.wikipedia).org/wiki/Gregory_Crewdson a distinction
reserved (by the site's own policy) for those enjoying defensible public
recognition.

The subject matter of his work is, to put it lightly, creepy. Most of
his images depict figures in various stages of undress, none possessing
what you might call _Grecian physiques_, in situations of emotional
distance, consternation, shock, or macabre solitude. The pools of light
and the occasional _volumetric_ beam add such a drama and intensity to
the stuff that it's hard to look away.

I'd love to see behind-the-scenes photos of his setups, but I couldn't
uncover much. Here is a [neat
walkthrough](http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/gallery/crewdsonline/)
of a Crewdson setup in Massachusetts, though they don't even show the
final image, which was a big disappointment for me.

There are some decent views of some of the setups he's used here on the
[Aperture 190](http://www.aperture).org/crewdson/ site; you can see that
he works mostly with *hot lights* (lights that remain on, as opposed
to strobes), just as though he was shooting a movie. The boston.com
article revealed that he shoots with an 8x10 view camera and apertures
as small as _f/45_, producing what must be the most amazingly detailed
and tack-sharp images. After reading that, I want to see a real Crewdson
print _up close and personal_.

Like Crewdson? Ever seen prints in person? _Comment below!_
