Ritz Camera, while providing useful and satisfying services to some, has
long been the target of my criticism. I find it laughable that
free-minded individuals would pay Ritz's extortionate prices for
equipment and gain nothing but instant gratification from the ordeal.
Their warranty leaves much to be desired, and though Ritz employees can
sometimes be knowledgeable, there is definitely no guarantee of that.

Someone who would walk into a Ritz Camera (or their other brands, like
Wolf Camera) and purchase a softbox made by some second-string
manufacturer solely on the recommendation of an AP stringer who got the
job at Ritz because the AP doesn't even like them that much (no offense
to AP stringers in general, here), is a fool. Plain and simple.

When the hardened, seasoned advice of a B&H sales associate is only a
phone call away, and when that advice is backed by an enormous inventory
of equipment available, usually immediately, from their warehouse, it
seems a ridiculous proposition to even set foot into a Ritz Camera
except in times of utter and complete desperation.

It surprises me to see customers milling about in Ritz without beads of
near-boiling sweat rolling down their faces, because I can't imagine a
world where trusting my needs to a place like Ritz could be anything
less than forced on me by dire circumstance.

That said, Ritz Camera has filed for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
protection.

The reign of terror is almost at its end.
