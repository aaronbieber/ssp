A comment was just posted over on my
[Art Concepts in Photography, Part 1: Texture](/articles/2007/08/02/art-concepts-in-photography-part-1-texture/) article,
but after I had composed my reply, I realized that it would be better suited to
an entire post. Here is the comment:

In the interest of full disclosure, I should probably mention that the comment
was posted by my father, who, having a degree in fine art and a gallery of his
own, takes a vested interest in some of the topics I discuss. That said, I
thought it was a very relevant question and one that many of you might have
thought about, too, so here's what I think. ~~MORE~~

First, it would depend on how knowledgeable the viewer was and how close they
could get to their subject. Second, there are many technologies available, so
the short answer is "probably," but the long answer is more interesting.

So-called "lightjet," which combines a digital (laser-based) exposure of
photographic paper with traditional (chemical) development methods, produces
very fine results, especially of full-color images. Upon very close inspection,
however, it would be clear that there are many colorful dots making up the
print. Still, these prints have fantastic longevity, are often quite lustrous,
and are available for a lot less money, comparatively, than other methods. An
added benefit is the ability to print on any brand and type of photographic
paper available to photographers, from Kodak Endura to Fuji Crystal
Archive. There is a certain _je ne sais quoi_ surrounding real photographic
papers that may be the strongest argument for lightjet.

Inkjet prints boast a longevity nearly comparable to traditional development and
are capable of a much broader range of color than lightjet. The highest-end
inkjet printers now deliver between seven and twelve physical inks in picoliter
droplets that mix on the paper to create a continuous tone image. The ink
droplets are dispensed by a piezoelectric system and can be either dye-based or
pigment-based, each having their own archival and color properties. Inkjet
printers, however, are much more expensive to run than ordering your prints from
a third-party photofinisher (who probably uses lightjet), and if you need the
highest quality available, you will have to buy, configure, and operate the
setup yourself, which is no small task!

Giclee (zhee-clay or gee-clay) has also held its own against the influx of
lower-cost inkjet solutions, boasting the ability to print on materials such as
canvas and at resolutions beyond what inkjet or lightjet typically can
achieve. Giclee (sometimes called Iris printing because one of the original
models was called Iris) is essentially a CMYK inkjet system, meaning that only
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks are used, though I have heard of giclee
printers that use six inks.  The ink is fired from glass nozzles at one million
droplets per second and each drop is electrically charged so it can be directed
toward or away from the paper by electromagnetism. The paper itself is affixed
to a drum that spins at about 180 inches per second. Giclee is probably one of
the most mechanically impressive printing methods around.

Artists have chosen giclee for years because of its faithful color reproduction
and ability to print on "artistic" substrates such as canvas. A single giclee
print, however, can cost \$50, \$100, or \$200 to produce, not including the
calibration and other services required to achieve the results you need. Giclee
is more favored by painters than photographers.

Four-color offset lithography, which is how all print publications are produced
nowadays, is actually capable of near-giclee quality, however American print
shops tend to be too traditionalist to adopt the color management methods
necessary to produce fine art prints to an exacting standard. Bill Atkinson, a
man absolutely _fanatical_ about color accuracy, collaborated with a Japanese
print shop to implement color management methodologies for their four-color
presses. In return, they printed his book of rock photographs. That book may be
the only example of accurate color reproduction through offset lithography on
any American bookshelf. The difference between the capabilities of high-end
offset lithography and giclee is entirely due to the willingness of the
technical staff involved to use modern digital color management methods.

At the end of the day, can any of these digital solutions deliver a result as
austere and striking as a pure black and white gelatin silver print? Probably
not, but they can come _very close_. I am convinced that Ansel Adams himself
would be a dedicated and outspoken advocate of digital photography and all of
its methods were he still alive today.
