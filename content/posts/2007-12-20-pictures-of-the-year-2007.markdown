If you'd like to see some of the most incredible and moving images from
2007, do take a few minutes (or more than a few minutes) to flip through
Reuters' "Pictures of the Year."

There are over 100 photographs from all over the world captured during
some of the most pivotal events of 2007, many of which I actually didn't
hear about until now. It's amazing exactly how much happens in a year
that we can be completely unaware of.

While these are photojournalism images, many of them could effortlessly
qualify as fine art.

Without further ado, [Reuters' Pictures of the Year
