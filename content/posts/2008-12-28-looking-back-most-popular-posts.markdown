I have a lot of new readers come through here, sometimes through Google,
sometimes Stumble Upon, and it occurs to me that it could be hard to
wade through the few years of content to find all the really _good
stuff_. Not that all of my posts aren't totally fantastic—because they
are—but there are a select few that I recommend everyone read.

On the occasions that I have people ask me for casual help getting
started with their new DSLR, I send them to these same articles as a
"primer," and to save me from repeating myself a lot.

So, without further ado, the most popular and essential articles in
three years of Single-Serving Photo:

* [Neutral Density
Filters](/articles/2008/02/21/neutral-density-filters/)
 * [Mastering the Only Five Camera
Settings](/articles/2008/06/30/mastering-the-only-five-camera-settings/)
 * [Art Concepts in Photography, Part 1:
Texture](/articles/2007/08/02/art-concepts-in-photography-part-1-texture/)
 * [Art Concepts in Photography, Part 2:
Composition](/articles/2007/08/26/art-concepts-in-photography-part-2-composition/)
 * [Art Concepts in Photography, Part 3: Positive/Negative
Space](/articles/2007/09/08/art-concepts-in-photography-part-3-positivenegative-space/)
 * [Histograms,
Huh?](/articles/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/)
 * [Resolution is a Myth: Calculating
DPI](/articles/2007/07/06/resolution-is-a-myth-calculating-dpi/)

I also decided to put this list on its own page. You can always get to
it from the "Essential Reading" link along the right side, or share that
page with your friends who are getting started.
