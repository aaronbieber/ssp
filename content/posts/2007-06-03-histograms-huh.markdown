I don't think there is a single digital photographer who hasn't, at one time or
another, looked at a histogram (much like the one below) and thought _What the
fuzz is this thing trying to tell me?_ If that describes you, or if you just
want to know more about this ubiquitous and curious graph, you've come to the
right place.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-1.gif)

Today I will unclothe the common histogram and show you not only how to read it,
but also how you can use it to strengthen your work.~~MORE~~

The histogram is a very powerful tool because it provides an instant window to
image information that is otherwise very difficult for a person to get a sense
of. According to the Photoshop CS manual,

> A histogram illustrates how pixels in an image are distributed by graphing the
> number of pixels at each color intensity level. This can show you whether the
> image contains enough detail in the shadows (shown in the left part of the
> histogram), midtones (shown in the middle), and highlights (shown in the right
> part) to make a good correction.

Most importantly for photographers, the histogram shows you this subtle
highlight and shadow information in a way that is completely independent of your
monitor's capabilities and color profiling.

Great, so it shows us detail information, or something like that. What does that
mean exactly? As stated in Adobe's definition above, the left side of the
histogram represents the darkest pixels in the image, while the right side
represents the lightest pixels. The height of each "bar" (in a Photoshop
histogram, each bar is one pixel wide) represents how many pixels of that
precise brightness exist in the image relative to all the other
brightnesses. All of this is much easier to understand if you can see it. So,
here:

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-2.gif)

I have conveniently numbered each shaded area of the image and their
corresponding histogram bars. The first thing you should notice is that the bars
move toward the right of the histogram as the shade gets lighter. Because areas
one, two, and three get progressively lighter by exactly the same amount, their
bars in the histogram are evenly separated. Likewise for areas four through
seven.

The next thing to notice is the height of the bars. How are the heights of these
bars calculated? An important note when looking at any histogram in Photoshop is
that the graph is _scaled_ so there is never any "wasted" vertical space. In
this case, bars one, two, and three are precisely one quarter the size of the
entire image, so even though the number of pixels in each of those sections is
precisely one quarter the number of pixels in the entire image, the bars are not
one quarter the height of the histogram. Why? Because there is no single shade
of pixel that has a higher _count_ than any of those sections (one, two, or
three). The graph is _scaled_ vertically.

Okay, so why are the bars for sections four through seven as tall as they are?
Each of those four sections of the image is _one quarter_ the size of section
one or two or three (as you can probably tell just by looking), so their bars in
the histogram are _one quarter_ the height of the bars for sections one, two,
and three. Is this all making some sense?

Just by looking at this histogram (which is harder to read by virtue of its
sparsity, but bear with me), we can actually see that the image must contain
precisely seven distinct pixel brightnesses ranging from completely black to
completely white (and look, it does!). Furthermore, we can see (for example)
that there are about one quarter as many pixels of brightness four than there
are of brightness three. Fantastic.

So what happens when the image has *many more* shades in it? Let's say, for
example, that it has *every* shade in it.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-3.gif)

Be honest: is the histogram at all what you would've expected it to be?  I was a
bit surprised to see that curve in there, but it does show us some things about
the Photoshop gradient tool that we might not have known before!

We have already drawn the first conclusion from this histogram: it contains
*every possible shade* of pixel. We know this because the data begins at the
very left edge and proceeds all the way to the very right edge without a single
gap. What happens if a shade is removed?

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-4.gif)

The attentive among you will notice that *two* changes have occurred.  First,
there is a pretty obvious gap where that particular shade of gray was
removed. Second, the bar at the very right edge is now filled in.  Why? Because
I covered the gray shade with a _white_ line, so the count of white pixels has
now increased! Brilliant.

Let's make a more drastic change and see how that affects the histogram display:

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-5.gif)

I have now removed most of the dark tones in the example image. Notice that the
histogram has a huge gap on the left side. No matter how large or small your
image is, the histogram always ranges from 100% black on the left to 100% white
on the right. Also notice that the tallest bar is the one at the far right, for
100% white. This is because there are more completely white pixels than pixels
of any other brightness in the image, so the histogram is now _scaled_ to the
height of that bar (the tallest bar).

By now you should be pretty comfortable getting the following information out of
a histogram:

* The range of tones in an image; does the image contain completely black and
  completely white tones, and is it missing tones anywhere in the range?

* Which tones occur most often in the image; which bars in the
  histogram touch the top?

That's a good start, but it won't make you more proficient at editing your
photographs. Let's take a look at a real example to see how what we've learned
applies to a photo.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-6.jpg)

Here is a photograph that I made at one of the (many) tobacco fields up in
Windsor, Connecticut. It was a foggy morning and, as you can see from the
histogram, there are no very light tones in this image at all (you can tell by
the large gap on the right side). Notice also that there is not a significant
amount of black (the curve on the left doesn't begin immediately at the left
edge).

I want to evenly brighten this image so that the sky area becomes white.
I will use levels for this (which I won't explain; there are ample
articles for using levels), but you could also use curves. Once I've
brightened the image, it might look more like this:

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-7.jpg)

There are two important things to notice about this histogram. First, you may
wonder why it's full of gaps. These gaps are a side-effect of expanding the
tonal range of an 8-bit image; Photoshop shifts and redistributes the tones in
the image to give the best perceptual result, but it doesn't (and cannot) create
more pixels with intermediate tones to complete the entire tonal range. This is
one of the linchpins in the 8-bit versus 16-bit editing debate, which I may
cover in a later article.

Second, you will notice that I now have a significant amount of pure white in
the image (the very last bar on the right goes all the way to the top of the
histogram), and the curve appears to be "cut off." This is _usually_ a bad
thing, because it tells you that you have _lost highlight detail_. If this were
a high-key portrait, or if your intent was to wash out the sky to pure white,
you would have succeeded. I didn't mean to do that, though, so I'm going to undo
that change and try again.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-8.jpg)

The changes in the photograph itself might be very subtle and difficult to see
on your monitor. This is the _entire point_ of the histogram.  By reading the
histogram, you can tell what's going on even if you can't see it in the
photo. Notice that I have not clipped as much of the highlight area of the tone
curve, leaving almost no pure white at all.  This tells me that my sky is going
to be filled almost entirely with _delicious digital sensor noise_, which will
give it a more continuous tone and realistic feeling.

By keeping an eye on your histogram, you can quickly and easily evaluate whether
or not you've achieved the result you were after. If your camera has the ability
to display a histogram you can even do this evaluation _in the field_. I
personally use the histogram display on my Canon 5D just about 100% of the time;
once I have seen the composition through the viewfinder, what I'm most concerned
with is the exposure, and the histogram allows me to see that no matter how
bright or dark it is, and no matter how accurate the camera's LCD display is. A
truly valuable tool!

That's it for our in-depth examination of the histogram and all of its exploits!
I hope you've enjoyed digging into the mechanics of this very useful tool and if
you have any remaining questions or if you think I screwed up anywhere along the
way, please leave a comment!

## Lightroom, Lightroom, Lightroom, Lightroom

![](/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-3-Software-for-Mac-Windows--150x150.jpg "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 Software for Mac & Windows")

While reading histograms directly on your camera is the first step toward
complete control of your exposure, no digital photographer should overlook the
importance of post-processing. When Adobe released Lightroom, I was already
using Apple's Aperture, but after only a few hours, I was ready to switch. I was
a Lightroom pre-release beta tester and I have purchased every upgrade to
Lightroom ever since; it's literally the killer app of killer apps.

Lightroom takes the histogram to the next level with RGB graphs and over- and
under-exposure views that actually show you on the photo itself where you're
losing detail. Not only is Lightroom an indispensable tool for developing
photographs, it's an awesome way to learn how imaging works.

If you haven't purchased Lightroom yet, let me urge you now, please, please buy
it. It will change the way you develop and organize your photos. On top of that,
if you buy it from B&H at their great price, and use one of the links below, you
help me keep this site online... Which I would really appreciate. Using these
links does not change your cost in any way, shape, or form.

If you are a student or a teacher, you can get a _huge_ discount by purchasing
the second one; it's absolutely identical in every way (except the box, it says
"Student & Teacher Edition" on it), but you do need to produce proof of your
student or teacher status.
