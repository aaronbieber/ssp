So you guys know that the Canon EOS-5D Mark II can shoot video, right?
It seems like video is the latest "must-have" feature for DSLRs, and
although I remain skeptical of its utility when it comes to the core
function of a DSLR (to make photographs, last I checked), it turns out
that there is something to be said for it.

As you read here not too long ago, the season finale of the hit Fox show
"House" (which I watch religiously) was shot entirely with 5D Mark II
cameras, proving that although it may not be as convenient or
feature-rich as a purpose-built digital cinema camera, it gets the job
done.

You don't need to be a technology _Nostradamus_ to see into a future
where tools of even the most complex trades trickle down to the masses.
Already, software capable of advanced video and music production are
within the grasp of any Joe (or Jane) Q. Public. The 5D Mark II is just
another example of the ever-increasing accessibility of truly capable
media creation tools.

Lest you doubt my words, watch this short film from Philip Bloom called
"Sofia's People." Shot entirely handheld with the 5D Mark II and a
Nikon-mount Zeiss 50mm f/1.4. According to Bloom, there was no
post-production other than massaging the frame rate (no image
modification at all).

When I say that the 5D Mark II's video is _absurd_, I mean _absurdly
awesome_.
