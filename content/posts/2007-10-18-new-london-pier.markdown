  content: Hello Aaron, I agree this is an excellent minimalist composition.  Have
    you seen the work of Michael Kenna?  His Japan series has a similar simplicity
    and quietness that you have expressed with this photo.

    Thanks, Phoebe! I am not familiar with Michael Kenna, but I won't be able to say that by tomorrow!

    I would be lying if I said I didn't have a strong love for minimalism.

I feel like I've been on a streak of article writing lately, which is
good, but I've also been neglecting the original charter of this
site--to post experimental and spontaneous photos. Fortunately, I've
been taking a lot of experimental and spontaneous photos, I just haven't
been _posting_ them. So, without further ado... the New London Pier on
a foggy morning.

This first one has a pretty wavy tone curve applied to it (in
Lightroom), which brings out that great bit of light in the sky while
not plowing all of the foreground shadow into an inky black mass. There
is also a split tone (blue for highlights, brown for shadows) that I
think gives it a very interesting feeling.

This one is almost my favorite minimalist composition _ever_, and
that's saying something. I'm a big stickler for minimalism (if you
didn't know), but what really grabs me about this is the wonderfully
placid reflections in the water on the left and, if you look closely,
the ever so subtle and soft point of land coming out on the right edge.

Enjoy.
