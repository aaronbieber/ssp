Using Lightroom is a joy compared to Photoshop. But it isn't a joy
compared to, for example, cheesecake. It's definitely nice to be able to
adjust nearly every aspect of an image with convenient sliders, to have
all of the settings right in front of you without having to open lots of
dialog boxes. At the same time, though, your mouse hand can get pretty
tired, and that never happens with cheesecake, now does it?

Never fear, there is finally a solution. Well, the beginning of a
solution. A solution in the early stages of beta testing, but a solution
nonetheless, and it doesn't involve uninstalling Lightroom and eating
more cheesecake. Although you are welcome to eat more cheesecake anyway
if that's your thing.~~MORE~~

No, friends, what I'm talking about is *Knobroom*. What is Knobroom?
Knobroom is a plug-in for Lightroom written by Jarno Heikkinen. Now hold
on, I know what you're going to ask: "What is that picture to the
right?" It's a good question. That is a Behringer B-Control Rotary
BCR2000 32-channel MIDI encoder panel.

Oh, you want to know what Knobroom does! You haven't guessed yet?
Knobroom connects the sliders in Lightroom to MIDI control channels.
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface and is essentially
the standard by which electronic instruments communicate with one
another (and with computers). The Behringer shown on the right is just
one example of a MIDI control panel that would commonly be used to
control volume, pan, vibrato, loudness, and other such attributes in
music software.

Of course, it's just a USB device that communicates through the
well-documented MIDI protocol, so Jarno wrote a plug-in that takes that
information and allows you to say "when knob 1 is turned, change the
exposure slider." This allows you to move settings up and down with the
knobs without having to move the mouse or even have the appropriate
panels in the develop module _open_.

How cool is that?!

I'm seriously considering the purchase of a Behringer BCR2000 as that is
the model Max Edin used in his demonstration video, which sort of proves
that it works. There are some issues and the software is in a beta stage
of development so you have to expect some bumps in the road, but it
looks very promising.
