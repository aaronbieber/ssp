My thorough and attentive friends in the B&H affiliate department have
sent word that they now have [limited stocks of 5D Mark
IIs!](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/583953-REG/Canon_2764B003_EOS_5D_Mark_II).html/BI/1816/KBID/2457

The message reads, "We've just received word that the Canon EOS 5D Mark
II is available in limited stock. Simply "add to cart"; ignore initial
"back-ordered" message."

According to Mike's post over at
[TOP](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/01/canon-5d-mark-ii-available-from-bh.html,)
their stock seems to be fluctuating in and out.

The price is \$2,699 and you can [buy it right
here](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/583953-REG/Canon_2764B003_EOS_5D_Mark_II.html/BI/1816/KBID/2457)
