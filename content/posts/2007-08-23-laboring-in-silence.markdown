It's really been a long time since I've posted! I must apologize to you,
my faithful readers, for this unusually long silence. A lot has been
going on! Let me bring you up to speed.

First, you may have noticed that just about one week ago my sites went
down for a full 24 hours. Apparently my web host suffered some kind of a
networking problem, though they weren't able to be more specific. To
make a long story short, I was completely displeased with their handling
of the situation and so I began putting things in motion to switch to a
more credible host. Right now I have secured a new hosting environment
and I am in the process of configuring it and getting ready to migrate
my sites over.

As a word of warning, the actual move may cause my sites to be
unavailable for an additional several hours, but unfortunately it can't
be helped. I think it will really be worth it to move to this new, more
reliable company.

Even as these networking troubles consume my every waking moment, I have
been toiling away at "Art Concepts in Photography Part 2," which I
really and truly hope to get posted next week. As a teaser, I'll tell
you that the focus of that post will be _composition_, a subject so
vast and nuanced that it has definitely put my writing abilities to the
test!

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the _blogosphere_ (a term that leaves a bitter
taste in my mouth but that I use anyway to satisfy you, my
lexicographically progressive readership), much has happened. My friend
Andrew from [goldengod](http://www.goldengod).net has been on an absolute
_streak_ of daily posting, stopping only momentarily to catch his
breath and mention the Canon EOS [tips I left on his
site](http://www.goldengod.net/2007/08/12/your-best-camera-specific-photography-tips/)
as well as [my latest
post](http://www.goldengod.net/2007/08/22/link-roundup-headless-chicken-edition/)
on digital printing. Thanks, Andrew!

Let us also not forget the momentous announcement of the Canon EOS 1Ds
Mark III, sporting 20+ megapixels of CMOS power and nothing less than an
$8,000 price tag. Let's hope this one can actually autofocus directly
out of the box, eh, Canon?

So stick around! There's a lot going on, but unfortunately it has all
been fairly hush-hush for the past couple of weeks. Remember, it's
always darkest right before the dawn.

While you're waiting, you can always [read my hand-picked photography
news](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/15563285598058491045/label/photography)
via Google Reader. This page will show you all the latest posts from the
several photography blogs I read daily. Who knows, maybe you'll find
something new!
