[![The Photoshop
Guys](/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/the-photoshop-guys-300x207.png "The Photoshop Guys")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/the_photoshop_guys.png)

You remember the National Association of Photoshop Professionals? NAPP?
Their president, Scott Kelby, is like _the_ Photoshop guy, he teaches
Photoshop and Lightroom and travels all around the world doing seminars
and evangelizing for Adobe (in an indirect way, as a representative of
over 30,000 people who use Photoshop professionally). He's as close to a
Photoshop guru as you can realistically get before you become Thomas
Knoll or Russell Brown.

What I'm trying to say here is that you really couldn't learn Photoshop
(or Lightroom) from any better folks than Scott Kelby and his Photoshop
crew (Corey Barker, Pete Collins, RC Concepcion, and of course Matt
Kloskowski). Normally this type of instruction costs a few bucks or at
least a trip somewhere. But not this week.

This week only, presented in a live format, Scott and his crew (he calls
them "The Photoshop Guys") are doing a series of retouching
presentations that you can watch for free. This starts tonight at 6 PM
EST. The presentations are, in order:

* Wedding Retouching (tonight, Dec. 5)
* Digital Makeup (Dec. 6)
* The Next Level of Retouching (Dec. 7)
* LIVE Show - Audience Participation in Q&A (Dec. 8)
* Tips from the Industry (Dec. 9)

My understanding is that the fourth presentation is the only time that
The Photoshop Guys will take any questions directly from the digital
audience, but all five presentations will be streamed live.

To tune in, just visit "Retouching Week on Photoshop
User":www.photoshopuser.com/retouching-week. It looks like the video and
chat feeds are having some problems at the moment, but since the event
has not yet started I'm sure the IT screw at Photoshop User will be able
to work out all the bugs before it gets underway tonight at 6.

I don't know about you guys but I'll be tuned in!
