I know it's been a super long time since I've posted, but I assure you
that it wasn't anything _you_ did. Perhaps it sounds like a lame
excuse but as much as I enjoy sharing photography news, tips, and ideas
with all of you, this blog is just a hobby and life has a way of
encroaching on hobbies sometimes.

That having been said, and in the theme of "shameless self-promotion," I
would like to (very, very happily) announce that I finally posted my
photos from both the Grand Teton National Park as well as Yellowstone
National Park; a trip that I took nearly a whole year ago. I hemmed and
hawed over which photographs to use and how to process them for an
enormous amount of time.

Here's one of my favorites from the Grand Prismatic Spring boardwalk at
Yellowstone:

Because I am eternally grateful to you, my gentle readers, my loyal
audience, for sticking around through months of crappy news posts and
half-hearted "copy pasta" articles, I would like to offer all of you
guys a *special secret discount on all of my prints for the entire
month*.

If you visit [my Yellowstone
gallery](http://aaronbieber.photoshelter.com/gallery/Yellowstone-NP-Wyoming/G0000FguDlRBESYc/P0000jNQBakpYdwI)
or [my Grand Teton
gallery](http://aaronbieber.photoshelter.com/gallery/Grand-Teton-NP-Wyoming/G0000lnL3Z9qOjS4/P0000jNQBakpYdwI)
or [my main site](http://gallery.aaronbieber.com/gallery-list) and you
use the "add to cart" link to purchase image downloads or prints of
*any photo* you can use the coupon code "SSP-MAY" to get *25% off
your order* for the entire month.

Here's my favorite image from the Grand Tetons, taken at Jenny Lake:

You can use this coupon code as many times as you want on any images you
want. Photographic prints are prepared and shipped by ExposureManager,
digital downloads are available immediately (have them printed by the
shop of your choice if you like).

The coupon code again is "SSP-MAY" and you can [start browsing my
