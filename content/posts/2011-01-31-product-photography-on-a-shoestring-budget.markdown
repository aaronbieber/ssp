Photography is awesome and I love it, but it's _super expensive_
sometimes. Photographers often commiserate with one another about the
high price tags on tripods and ball heads (or sometimes they gloat, but
the nice ones commiserate), and if you get into studio photography you
are often getting into a whole new world of expenses from strobes and
stands to backdrops and gels.

Now, it definitely pays off to have the right tools for the job, and
that starts to become glaringly apparent when you're doing work with
people, but for so-called tabletop product photography you can often get
by with some home improvement supplies and a little ingenuity and
patience.

After the break, the resident product photographer and editor at
Handmadeology shares a \$12 product studio setup that yielded the image
on the right.~~MORE~~

Handmadeology is a blog owned by Tim Adam, a metalcrafts guy who started
selling on the Etsy marketplace and wanted to share his tips and ideas
with the Internet at large. Handmadeology is very focused on items to be
found on Etsy and ideas for improving your sales through Etsy, but this
particular post by contributing writer Mariano definitely overlaps into
Single-Serving Photo territory.

Using a window, some paper, cardboard, a simple clamp, and aluminum
foil, Mariano can get a very clean seamless image that you might think
was taken in a [cloud
dome](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/347666-REG/Cloud_Dome_CD159012_Cloud_Dome_90mm).html/BI/1816/KBID/2457
or using one of those [infinity
boards](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/347667-REG/Cloud_Dome_CDIB18W_Infinity_Board_Matte_White.html/BI/1816/KBID/2457.)
Check out the link below to read Mariano's full article and see how it
was done.
