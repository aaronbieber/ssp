### Part One: Kites

Chris Benton is a professor of architecture at the University of
California, Berkeley. He also straps his digital SLR onto a kite string
and takes some of the most amazing aerial photographs I have ever seen.
Chris combines a truly gifted eye for composition with a an engineer's
savvy for mechanical problem solving.

Using kites and remote-controlled camera rigs built by hand in his
basement, Chris captures the world top-down, photographing everything
from people and buildings to the patterns of nature. Watch this video
from Make Magazine and be _stunned!_

Chris is quick to humbly share his experience and tips for aerial kite
photography [on his website](http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/kap/index).html
(graciously hosted by Berkeley!)

I was blown away by the evolution of Chris's camera rigs, which grew
from fixed harnesses with rudimentary mechanical timers based on elastic
bands, Silly Putty, and disposable cameras, to what he now uses, a
remote-controlled, servo motor-driven, three-axis _robot_.

It's definitely not commonplace for someone to possess both a grasp of
electronic and mechanical engineering *and* a hawk-eye for artistic
composition. Chris Benton has both.

### Part Two: Cars

Aside from being an avid photographer, I admit to a streak of BMW
_fanboyism_. When it comes to sports cars that are still solid daily
drivers that make you feel like you've personally discovered the center
of the universe and you're sitting directly within it, nobody does it
better than BMW.

To hype the release of their latest creation, the Z4 Roadster, BMW hired
artist Robin Rhode to dip the Z4's tires in multi-colored paints and
drive it around like a fingerpainting on a warehouse scale. This was one
of the most indulgent marketing campaigns I could think of.

I realize this isn't strictly photography-related, but it is certainly
art-related. If you feel gypped, go [look at these photographs from the
event](http://www.bmwblog.com/2008/12/20/new-bmw-z4-painting-dynamics/an-expression-of-joy-painting-dynamics-created-by-the-new-bmw-z4_9/)

And here is a pretty cool video of how they put this thing together:

The next time you're out shooting, or sitting around the house thinking
about how next to use that studio space you set up in the basement, or
the garage, or the attic... Think about breaking out of the box and
doing something completely different. Robin Rhode did, and I think it
came out pretty well.
