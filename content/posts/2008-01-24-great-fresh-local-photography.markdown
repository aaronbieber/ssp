In the style of chef Gordon Ramsay, I will now shake my hand in the air
beside my head and exclaim that the solution for anyone's languishing
business or hobby is to stay fresh, local, and honest. Though chef
Ramsay is usually talking about _produce_ and _grass-fed beef_, I am
talking about capturing scenes right in your own community.

I might have mentioned in passing that my "day job" brought me to New
London, Connecticut almost two years ago. New London is a rather scenic
city positioned on the bank of the Thames river—very near to its
mouth—which empties into the Long Island Sound. Although not without its
social and economic problems, it is a historic city with a great deal of
architectural and maritime attractions.

I was absolutely _floored_ to be reading [The Online
Photographer](http://www.theonlinephotographer.com) and to run across a
stunning photograph taken literally five minutes up the opposite bank of
_my_ river (yes, I own the river) in Groton, Connecticut by Tom
Kaszuba (check out [the post in
question](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/01/random-excellen.html,)
[his website](http://www.tomkaszuba.com/), and [his Flickr
page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tomkaz/)). As one would expect, he's
received over 60 comments on that photo on Flickr, probably many thanks
to Mike at TOP, and all of them are well-deserved.

So anyway, here is the image.

_The Lighthouse Sanctuary_, by Tom Kaszuba. New London, Connecticut.

Taking a few minutes to look through Tom's Flickr page invigorated me
and inspired me to photograph the very river and scenery surrounding me
here in New London. He has captured the coast of the Thames and the city
of New London in a unique and flattering way. My hat is off to you, Tom;
keep up the great work!

*Edit:* One of my favorite blogs,
[Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com), just posted a short article with
a similar message, [Take a Cheap Vacation in Your Own
City](http://lifehacker.com/348407/take-a-cheap-vacation-in-your-own-city.)
Therein, they suggest grabbing a guidebook for your area (you can
usually find them at visitor's centers, on your city or town's website,
at the city or town hall, or in a local library) and doing some of the
suggested activities or visiting the suggested locations. This could be
another great way to revitalize your photography without spending a lot
or going too far.
