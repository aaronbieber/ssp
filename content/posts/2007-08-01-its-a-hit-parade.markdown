I want to take a moment to thank everyone who has returned to read this
humble blog time and time again. You guys and gals consistently offer
insightful and useful comments and I really appreciate your
participation. The month of July was a benchmark in Single-Serving
Photo's history, reaching 2,442 unique visitors, the most who have ever
stopped by in a single month!

For laughs, here are some other statistics that might interest you:
 * The most-visited article is [Histograms,
Huh?](/articles/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/) with
about 2,465 views.
 * The single most active day was the 16th of July with 582 unique
visitors, which--not coincidentally--is the same day Scott Kelby posted
his links wrap-up article mentioning my Histograms piece.
 * You guys love reading my blog on Mondays and Tuesdays, but not so
much on Saturdays and Sundays.
 * Between 3 and 4 PM (Eastern) is the most popular time to drop by.
 * 46% of you are using Firefox, while only 31% are using Internet
Explorer (that's cause enough for celebration if you ask me!)
 * The majority of you found me through Photography Voter (great
site!), while many others found me through StumbleUpon (also a great
site!).
 * Of the few of you who found my site through a web search, the most
popular keywords that led you here were "lightroom," "watermark," and
"focal." I'll take it!

Thanks again for visiting! I have a lot of great ideas brewing so you're
not going to want to miss what's coming up!
