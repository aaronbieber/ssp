I know I talk a pretty serious game most of the time, but I also like to
have fun now and then. I recently stumbled upon a pretty hilarious
series of videos by a guy named Donnie Hoyle called "You Suck at
Photoshop." They're basically Photoshop tutorials, but presented in a
rather cynical, somewhat spiteful, and utterly entertaining way.

Trust me, if you have a few minutes, just watch one or two of these and
you'll see what I mean. I should mention that there is _some_ coarse
language, so try not to get in trouble watching these at high volume in
the office, OK?

I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.
