In a previous article, [Shooting Modes
Explained,](/articles/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/)
I went into some of the details of the major shooting modes (aperture
priority, shutter priority, manual) and the program modes (what Canon
calls "PictureStyles" and Nikon calls "Digital Vari-Programs").

All of that information is still very important, but I wanted to mention
that a good fellow by the name of [Adam
Parker](http://blogs.adamparkerphotography.com/blogs/) posted a comment
there with a useful link to an article of his where he demonstrates the
major shooting modes using... Gasp... Pictures!

You can read his article, [Canon Shooting Modes - What Are the
Differences?](http://blogs.adamparkerphotography.com/blog/Canon-Shooting-Modes-What-are-the-differences/29/)
at that link. Bear in mind that it is a very Canon-centric article, and
therefore I fully support it!

If you have a Nikon or one of those... _Other_ cameras... This
information may still apply, though the names of the modes will probably
be different, or you may have more or fewer of them.
