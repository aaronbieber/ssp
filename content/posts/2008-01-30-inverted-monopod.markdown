This sweet video from someone called "cobbler" on
[Metacafe](http://www.metacafe.com) shows you how to make a rather
ingenious _image stabilizer_, which I have decided to call an
"inverted monopod."

I won't ruin the surprise, nor will I keep you from the video, which is
right here:

Metacafe](http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1041948/1_image_stabilizer_for_any_camera_lose_the_tripod/))

Personally, I think this idea is brilliant and I give a tip of my cap to
"cobbler," whoever and wherever they may be.
