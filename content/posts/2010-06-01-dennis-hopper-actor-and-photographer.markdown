![Self-portrait at Porn Stand (c) Dennis Hopper](/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/1119hopperB-199x300.jpg "Self-portrait at Porn Stand (c) Dennis Hopper")

As I'm sure you've heard, Dennis Hopper passed away just days ago (the 29th of
May, 2010). As an actor, I personally loved his roles in such classics as _Super
Mario Bros._, _Waterworld_, and _Speed_, though he is best known for _Easy
Rider_, _Rebel Without a Cause_, _Cool Hand Luke_, and more. He certainly had a
knack for the dramatic, but what I didn't know was that he also had a knack for
photography.

The "Chasing Light" blog has a [wonderful post][post] containing photos that
Hopper took through the years (all of them black and white). I was very
impressed with them; they show attention to composition and subject comparable
to those of a seasoned professional or serious hobbyist. You could certainly
call Hopper a serious hobbyist, though he was more widely known for his feature
films than for his [photography, painting, and sculpture][photos].
