[![Lens

Fashion. It is not the subject of this blog. Nevertheless, those of you
out there who have _not_ been living beneath a heavy boulder,
sheltered from the comings and goings of the world around you, have very
likely picked up on this _silicone bracelet trend_.

Perhaps calling it a "trend" at this stage is an embarrassing betrayal
of my actual disinterest in fashion when you consider that the silicone
(or "gel") bracelet was popularized in 2004 by Lance Armstrong's
"LIVESTRONG" campaign, for which Nike produced tens of thousands of the
yellow wristbands. Still, I keep seeing new ones turn up so let's just
pretend it's still trending.

Either way, these colorful, flexible, waterproof bands have been
co-opted by countless campaigns, companies, and movements since Lance
popularized them. They are inexpensive to make, comfortable to wear, and
you don't even have to take them off since they will survive just about
anything your body will, which puts them high in the running for what I
would consider the ideal fashion accessory, not that I'm keeping score
or anything.

Finally, photographers can join the throngs of people wearing silicone
bracelets and make a clever fashion statement while doing it thanks to
Adam Elmakias, creator of the simply and accurately named Lens Bracelet
(a stack of his bracelets is pictured above).

Show your true colors (whether they be Canon "L" red or Nikon Nikkor
gold) and wear your favorite focal lengths, literally, on your sleeve
with one of a variety of Lens Bracelet designs suitable for both the
Canon and Nikon crowds. Sorry, no Olympus, Sony, Panasonic, or Leica
Lens Bracelets yet.

Compared to bracelets made of similar material on offer from other
vendors for other purposes, the \$10 price tag seems a little bit high.
Still, I did spend \$50 on a coffee mug shaped like a 70-200 f/4L, so it
is hard for me to say that I would never buy one. Or two. Or maybe
three... But certainly no more than six.
