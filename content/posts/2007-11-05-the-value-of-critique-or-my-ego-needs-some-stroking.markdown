    The Value of Critique, or: My Ego Needs Some Stroking...

    It’s now easier to solicit feedback about your photographs than it is to fall out of a boat and hit water. Unfortunately, comments are seldom used to give constructive criticism or to share practical knowledge. Why?...

  content: Aaron- would you believe I've never checked out PhotoSig before?  great
    tip!  It's interesting to read other artists perspective on this topic-  I like
    your point about having an "artistic vocabulary" to aid in critique.  I think
    I was trying to get at something like that in my article, but that is a great
    way of putting it. Hope you don't mind if I steal that phrase (with credit of
    course :-)

  content: The premise behind photo critique sites like PhotoSIG and Photo.net is
    great. But the reality is that, like in Flickr, only the "pretty" pictures get
    good critiques and people end up doing the same kind of pictures. I'm pretty sure
    that people like Lee Friedlander or Alec Soth would get trashed at these sites.

    One of the best things about participating on PhotoSIG is that nobody really gets "trashed." It's true, people have submitted work to that site with virtually no redeeming value, and people speak their minds, but one of PhotoSIG's tenets is respect, and they _do_ enforce it.

    I see what you're saying, Eve, and it's true that Flickr, Photo.net, DeviantArt, and other "simple" comment-based sites foster a groupthink environment where the strongest signals come from the least controversial and most-liked work overall, rather than from the "long tail" of very good work appreciated only by a choice few.

    In the case of Flickr, their open API allows for some engineering of that behavior. Tools such as [Flickr DNA](http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/dna).php show how a little bit of outside data mining can help you find things you wouldn't normally see by surfing the popularity charts as measured by Flickr.

    If we ignore discovery, though, and focus on pure critique, Flickr, Photo.net, and DeviantArt seldom deliver the volume of usable critique that PhotoSIG does simply because of the simple comment system they have in place. You will see a lot of new and amazing work happening on PhotoSIG every day.

Thanks to a surge in "community" features being implemented on
practically every website, it's now easier to solicit feedback about
your photographs than it is to fall out of a boat and hit water. In
other words, _pretty damn easy!_

{% random right %}

_Fantastic_, you might think, _the more feedback the better!_ Well,
true, except that a lot of people calling themselves "serious hobbyists"
or "beginning professionals" simply seek out the most positive feedback
they can get and live in a world totally isolated from how completely
awful their work really is. Paul Indigo asks a question on his blog,
Beyond the Obvious: [_do photo enthusiasts really want to
learn?_](http://paulindigo.blogspot.com/2007/11/do-photo-enthusiasts-really-want-to.html)
In his article, Paul wonders about the true intentions of people who
demonstrate fundamental misunderstanding of the "art concepts of
photography":/tag/desgn and blame it on insufficient equipment or
software. If these people want to learn, shouldn't they be more open to
feedback? ~~MORE~~

Ed Zawadzki takes it a step further and asks whether the [art of
critique](http://www.f1point0.com/2007/11/02/the-art-of-the-critique) has
fallen by the wayside to be replaced by the blind exchange of accolades.
You can certainly see that happening a lot on some of the larger and
less organized sites, such as [DeviantART](http://www.deviantart.com) and
even a bit on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com), though the overall intent
of Flickr is much more casual, which deserves to be mentioned.

{% random left %}

A site like DeviantART, with its many thousands of self-proclaimed
artistic users, has the capacity to act as the medium for an
incalculable volume of helpful critique. The stage, however, was not set
for that mode of discourse; DeviantART's commenting system is used, by
and large, for the distribution of praise, and there is no technological
nor social pressure in place to counter that. After browsing the site
for only a short while, you are given the impression that offering
criticism is inadvisable, if not downright _prohibited_.

DeviantART follows in the footsteps of many other social applications
which, in want of remaining neutral, offer no specific guidelines or
technical hurdles to shape the course of conversation. It turns out that
when people are presented with an enormous and varied selection of
content, they choose only the things they _like_ to make comments
about. That's fair enough, and it's wonderful to receive copious
plaudits as a creator—you might say that commendations grease the cogs
of creation—but artists in search of higher plateaus, those truly
interested in growth, need _more_. They need _critique_.

{% random right %}

That's where [PhotoSIG](http://www.photosig.com) steps in. With a unique
system of critique scoring (not to mention using the word "critique" in
the first place), PhotoSIG is able to encourage its members to _think
critically_, even if the feedback is completely positive. The number of
photographs a user can post in a single day is limited, but additional
postings can be earned by submitting "conforming" critiques, which
simply means that the critique meets a 15-word minimum and is among the
first three to be posted.

Critique authors are asked to follow these guidelines (snagged from the
critique posting page):

* If you're here to give someone a thumbs-down critique because that
person gave you a thumbs-down critique, then erase your critique and
cool off for a bit.
 * A critique is not a judgment. Make your critiques helpful by
suggesting ways in which the photographer can improve his or her photo.
Don't simply state whether you like the photo or dislike it.
 * An unflattering critique can be very constructive, but you must take
care to be as polite and respectful as possible. Ask yourself how you
would feel if someone made the same comment about one of your own
photos.
 * Critique the photo, not the photographer or the other critics.
 * If this photo already has a lot of critiques, then think about
whether you have anything new to add. Instead of writing a "me too"
critique, why not critique something else?
 * The three thumbs-down rating should be reserved for photos that are
clearly offensive or repugnant, not those that are merely bad. You may
be asked to justify or revisit a three thumbs-down rating.

Those are what I would call _guidelines to shape the course of
conversation_. By abiding by those very simple rules, a writer is sure
to offer something of some use to the photographer. If the critique
qualifies as "conforming" (as described up above), the photographer may
rate the critique as "helpful," which earns the writer extra _points_
that he or she may use to upload additional photos and so on. If,
however, the photographer rates the critique as "unhelpful," the writer
will _lose_ points.

This very straightforward point-based system creates an environment of
open and honest communication among PhotoSIG's users, and it is among
the best systems out there right now. I don't know if a site such as
PhotoSIG exists for art of a non-photographic nature, but if one does
not... Someone should create it.

Although it's been some time since I've been active on PhotoSIG, you can
nevertheless [read some of my
critiques](http://www.photosig.com/go/users/userphotocritiques?id=146708)
of others' work. If you have photos up on PhotoSIG and you'd like me to
swing by and write you a critique, leave a comment below; I'd be glad
to. Likewise, if you want to [critique some of
mine](http://www.photosig.com/go/users/userphotos?id=146708), be my
guest.

It's always interesting to get others' views on a piece. Even if you
don't always get the most well-written, fluent, useful, spectacular
critiques in the world, you cannot hope to learn if you do not
participate.
