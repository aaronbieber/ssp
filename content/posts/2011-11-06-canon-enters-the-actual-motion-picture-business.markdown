[![Canon Cinema EOS
C300](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/EOS-C300_EF-Mount_body_CN-E85mm_LF_3_4-1_polaroid-300x232.png "Canon Cinema EOS C300")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/EOS-C300_EF-Mount_body_CN-E85mm_LF_3_4-1_polaroid.png)

I've posted about Canon's involvement in the filmmaking industry before;
in my cheekily titled [Canon 5D Mark II in the (Dr.) House](/articles/2010/04/14/canon-5d-mark-ii-in-the-dr-house/)
I reported on the use of the EOS-5D Mark II to film an entire season
finale episode of House M.D.

Since then, the hipster Vimeo community has been running their Converse
All-Stars threadbare filming hundreds of hours of content with the 5D
Mark II and thoroughly enjoying it. But the 5D Mark II remains, at its
core, a still camera. I mean, that's what it was designed to do. The
ability to record video is a cute add-on, and although it works very
well for small-scale filmmakers in oversized scarves and skinny jeans,
it falls short on many features a crew would need to film a real movie
(regardless of wardrobe). ~~MORE~~

At the same time, high-end optics mogul Jim Jannard, founder of the
well-known Oakley eyewear company, has been building a new empire around
his peculiarly named Red cameras, poised to literally transform the
filmmaking industry with modular, extensible, relatively inexpensive
(operative word here, _relatively_), and staggeringly performant
digital cine cameras.

So performant, in fact, that Peter Jackson was reported to have bought
48 of the things to film his upcoming Hobbit movie, and now word is out
that James Cameron slapped around \$3 million on the proverbial barrel
head for 50 or so of Jannard's black-and-red hand-machined devices.

On the tails of this nearly complete transformation of the entire
filmmaking industry into yet another contributor to our practically
unsustainable hoard of digital data, Canon has announced that it is
throwing its hat into the ring with what they are calling the Cinema EOS
C300.

The camera will reportedly hit the market in early 2012, but it has
already been making the rounds in some exclusive circles as Canon worked
with filmmakers to ensure that all of the proper functionality was in
place. Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer and Canon Explorer of Light
Vincent Laforet was invited to use the C300 in his upcoming short film
MÃ¶bius and Vimeo was there behind the scenes to document that
experience.

In the Vimeo piece, Laforet gushes about the C300; its image quality,
the extent to which Canon integrated filmmakers' specific suggestions,
and about Canon's new cine-specific lens, the 30-300mm f/2.9-3.7, which,
balanced on his knee, looks like it probably weighs at least ten pounds.

The retail cost is said to be around \$20,000, which is just above the
low target for these digital cine cameras (Red cameras can cost anywhere
between \$17,000 and \$60,000 depending on options, and even that is a
fraction of what film cinema cameras cost).

Is Canon shifting their business toward the cinema given that Nikon is
kicking them up and down the street with huge and practically noise-free
sensors? Are they facing financial challenges that has prompted them to
search for more revenue streams? Will this foray into the cinema
industry forsake those of us who are still fiercely loyal to their still
camera brand?

These questions and more will undoubtedly be answered in the coming year
as the C300 is released into the wild.
