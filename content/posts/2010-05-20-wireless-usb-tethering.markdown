Little did I know of the abilities of so-called "tethering," for I had
never tried it myself.

In the photography realm, tethering is a term generally used to describe
shooting while the camera is directly connected to a computer. Most
often, it is used to instantly push the photos onto the computer so that
they can be previewed or, in some extreme cases, immediately edited by
someone else for review by an on-site art director and so forth.

So really, "wireless tethering" is a super oxymoron, but that's what
they call it when you control your camera wirelessly or retrieve the
photos in realtime wirelessly. Canon makes a device for this, and it
retails for *_\$800_*. I think you'd really have to need it to spend
that much.

At least, that's what Jamie Carl thought, so he made his own. Basically,
tethering nowadays is just a standard USB connection, the same
connection that you use to download photos directly from the camera (if
you ever do that). They actually make wireless USB extenders now, which
basically just separate one end of a USB cable from the other using
wireless technology. It works just like USB, for just about anything
that talks through USB.

I'm not sure what the bandwidth is like, but for controlling your
camera, you don't need much.

Jamie wanted to have wireless control of his camera because he was going
to be riding in a car at highway speed, with his Nikon dangling outside
on a mounting bracket! It seems like it worked out pretty well!
