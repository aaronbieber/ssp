I don't usually do these short news-breaking stories, but this one
actually irked me. [Rob
Galbraith](http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/noad_page.asp?cid=6),
notable photographer and outstpoken reviewer of photographic equipment
and technique, published [a
story](http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-9320-9876)
in his blog, _Rob Galbraith: DPI_, pitting the late-2008 unibody
MacBook Pro 15" display against the displays of two similar laptops, the
Dell Inspiron and the IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad T60.

Conclusion? Despite Apple's long-held position as a maker of laptops
uniquely suited to field shooting, Galbraith says, "In ambient light
environments which induce screen reflections, the late-2008 MacBook Pro
15 inch's glossy screen moves deep into the not acceptable category."

Though it remains in the running for one of the more accurate displays
among laptops, it fails to outshine the Inspiron or the ThinkPad in
overall color accuracy or viewing angle flexibility, according to
Galbraith's hands-on analysis.

Of course nothing is totally black and white in the field of photography
or even technology, so be sure to [read his full
review](http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-9320-9876)
and peruse some of the responses on the [Slashdot
