You already know that [I teach photography
workshops](http://artphotoworkshops.com), right? My buddy
[Chris](http://curiouslens.com) and I have been teaching workshops for
almost four years now, and although things were pretty slow in 2009, we
are pushing ahead with a packed workshop schedule for 2010.

When you come on a workshop with Chris and I, you get to stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with a total of 20 years of photography experience,
heckle us with questions, meet people, and generally have a good time.
_Two_ instructors, awesome locations, and, here's the sweet part...
I'm giving you a discount.

Because you are still reading my humble blog after months of silence and
because I value your loyalty and participation, I am offering you a
great deal on my workshops this year. If you register for _any
workshop_ before _March 1st_, I'll give you *10% off the price*,
just by mentioning this blog article when you sign up.

I'll tell you what else. Just because I'm in such a good mood and
excited to teach this year, if you want to register for more than one,
I'll give you *20% off of each of them*. All you have to do is mention
that I said so in the comments when you're signing up [on my
website](http://artphotoworkshops.com.)

Look at this great lineup of workshops we have coming up this year!
