[![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Pre_Order_1_X_Ca_4b9a382b666ea-263x300.jpg "Canon 70-200 Coffee Mug")](http://www.canonmugs.com)

When I first heard that Canon had made almost exact replica 70-200 f/4
_coffee mugs_ for the Olympics in Vancouver, I had to have one.
Unfortunately, they only made a small number of the mugs for the games,
as a novelty hand-out for press photographers and such, and finding one
was challenging to say the least.

*But I did.* And now I want to share this novelty with you, my dear
reader.

Just a little warning here: these replica lens coffee mugs are not
exactly _cheap_. Whether due to their rarity or because they're
limited-run items, they are priced more like high-end souvenirs than
mugs.

Currently, the best source for these mugs is
[canonmugs.com](http://www.canonmugs.com), a charmingly "Engrish" site
that evidently has either come into a huge collection of the original
novelty mugs, or has outsourced their replication to some far-flung
country. My guess is that these are actually replicas of the original
novelty mugs, but I do own the Canon 70-200 mug and it's as well-made as
you would expect for such a thing.

The site also sells replica Nikon lens coffee mugs so you Nikon lovers
can join the fun as well.

The only thing I wish my mug had is a real EF mount and cap on the
bottom, rather than the rubber base that resembles a cap. If I could
actually mount it on my camera, I could be seen nonchalantly detaching
it and filling it with liquid, and that would be _priceless_.
