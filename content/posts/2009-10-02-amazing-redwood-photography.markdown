![Michael Nichols/National Geographic](/articles/redwood.jpg)It really
excites me that people are out there coming up with new techniques for
photographing difficult subjects. It excites me even more that National
Geographic has it in their budget.

Over on the right you see a photograph taken by Michael â€œNickâ€?
Nichols (and his team) for National Geographic, which is on the cover
(well, part of it is on the cover, itâ€™s a huge photograph) of the
October issue of the magazine.

The image was made by jigsawing 83 separate photographs together (which
you can probably tell by the jagged edges), each of which was taken by
one of three DSLR cameras mounted on a gyroscope-leveled, pulley-lowered
rig that Nichols and his team designed for the purpose. You can check
out the photo on [Hack a
Day](http://hackaday.com/2009/09/30/multi-camera-rig-makes-trees-say-cheese/)
of Nichols with his rig; it looks like theyâ€™ve got six Pocket Wizards
on there (I donâ€™t know what the other three are for) and maybe a
couple of bicycle wheels. All in all, a very righteous hack.

This particular redwood is allegedly the â€œmost architecturally
interestingâ€? tree in the world, with several forks and bends
stretching 300 feet into the sky. Itâ€™s only been standing there for
over 1,500 years(!!), but now it has been recorded in the annals of
photographic history forever.
