In his [latest blog
post](http://www.chasejarvis.com/blog/2008/02/free-photos-and-artistic-vision.html,)
Chase Jarvis mentions Wired editor Chris Anderson's new book, _FREE_,
which is more or less about the effects that digital media has had on
the cost of distribution of creative works.

I haven't read the book so I don't claim to know what Anderson's
conclusions might be, though I have spent a lot of time ruminating on
this whole _free content movement_ that is slowly developing and I
think it deserves some discussion. More of my ramblings after the
jump. ~~MORE~~

Anderson mentions something he calls _zero marginal cost_, which
refers to the fact that the cost of distributing digital assets nowadays
is approaching zero. By comparison to pre-digital, pre-Internet
distribution models, the cost is effectively zero. This means that the
words I'm typing right now and the images that surround them are
reaching you at virtually no cost (to me or to you).

So what happens if we make the presumption that photography is a zero
marginal cost business for the distributors? Photographs as salable
assets have been slinking closer and closer to commodification with each
passing day, meaning that much photographic content is bought and sold
on the basis of price alone. For stock and travel photography, this
seems to be even more true.

This theory dovetails with something rather surprising that Dan Heller
said last night. He said (I'm paraphrasing) that his photographs really
have no intrinsic value. Maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but his
point was that even though he has tens of thousands of photographs, they
can pretty much be replaced or reproduced, so even the entire collection
is of little inherent value; it's the business model and organization
that surrounds them that makes them into a product and a profitable
enterprise. In short, it's _Dan himself_ that people pay for.

Chase Jarvis said almost the same thing in his entry when he concluded
that photographers of the future "will make their money getting hired to
deliver their commissioned, artistic vision for the newest product,
trend, or photo of the moment, NOT to deliver the ones and zeros from
yesterday's digital file."

I won't go as far as to say that photographs themselves are worthless,
because I truly don't believe that. Nevertheless, if you want to be
successful in the photography business, or to make money through
photography in any way, you have to be intimately aware of what you're
selling and who wants to buy it from you.
