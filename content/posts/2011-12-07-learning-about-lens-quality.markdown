[![MTF at 24mm](/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-05-at-7-150x150.png "MTF at 24mm")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-05-at-7.png)

Today on Single-Serving Photo I'm bringing you something a little bit
different. Instead of news stories about amazing photographers, press
releases about equipment you can't afford, or overbearing pontifications
on the usefulness of HDR as a medium for artistic expression... Drumroll
please... _Graphs_.

To be more specific, graphs of _modulation transfer functions._
Dry-sounding? Absolutely! Exciting? I sure hope so! ~~MORE~~

As the title suggests, today's episode is concerned with lens quality.
To be more precise, metrics that measure lens quality. To be yet more
precise, metrics that measure sharpness, which is universally regarded
to be a major factor in lens quality.

In this day and age, though it's useful to hold equipment in your hands,
to hear the sounds it makes, to feel its controls and its weight, nobody
buys a professional camera or lens on the basis of a visit to the shop.
That is, unless they're quite wealthy and don't mind making expensive
errors in judgment.

No, no, this is the _information age_, the age of _silicon_ and
_fiber optics_ and _space travel_ and _ray guns_ and... Well, not
ray guns. But _computers_ and _cell phones_ and _quartz watches_
and, oh yeah, that other little thing called _the Internet_.

That's the Internet with a capital "I," the one that connects computers
worldwide, that connects my incoherent ramblings to you in the comfort
of your own home at this very moment, and not least of all, that allows
you to meticulously research every purchase you want to make, no matter
how insignificant.

When it comes to researching lenses, if you've ever been down this road,
you've probably come across one of my favorite sites,
[dpreview.com](http://www.dpreview.com). Digital Photography Review (as
it's formally named) is probably the most technically thorough camera
and lens review site in existence. They aren't going to give you a whole
lot of aesthetic or subjective fluff. Instead, they're going to give you
boat loads of data, and if you're reading their lens reviews one of the
first things you're going to notice is the interactive lens sharpness
tool.

What dpreview has done is created their own interactive tool for viewing
the data points produced by many, many combined _modulation transfer
function_ graphs, which allows you to choose different focal lengths
(on zoom lenses) and f-stops and observe the sharpness performance of
the lens based on their measurements.

By looking at MTF measurements made by reviewers, you can determine the
"sweet spot" aperture setting and focal length for a given lens and use
that to produce images of a sufficient sharpness that you will be able
to print them out at obscene dimensions and wave them around in front of
your friends boasting about the clarity and detail you've been able to
achieve.

After all, that's what friends are for, right?

Now, if you want to know more about the mechanics of MTF calculations and how
these measurements are taken and what they mean (which is truly interesting
stuff), I highly recommend that you take a look at
[Camera Lens Quality: MTF, Resolution & Contrast](http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/lens-quality-mtf-resolution.htm)
written by Sean McHugh on the awesome Cambridge in Colour site. This is one of
the more detailed explanations I've seen with attractive and understandable
illustrations (which is the only way I can ever understand anything; you have to
draw me a picture).

If you want to peruse some lens reviews and play with interactive MTF graphs,
start by reading dpreview's announcement of their new lens reviews and how their
interactive tool works:
