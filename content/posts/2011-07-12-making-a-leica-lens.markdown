You guys are going to love this video of the making of a Leica lens.
Admittedly, I have never owned a Leica camera or lens, but their
reputation is world-renowned and it's worth seeing the care that they do
put into their products. For what it's worth, many Canon lenses are
hand-assembled as well (certainly the "L" lenses are) and the effort
pays off.
