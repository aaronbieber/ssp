[![ShareThis](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/1320754782522_a2b17.png "ShareThis")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/1320754782522_a2b17.png)

I try not to gush too frequently over the changes and updates that I
make to this blog. Especially when they don't really impact you, my dear
readers. Occasionally, though, there is a change that I feel I should
explain so that you know what's happening and what I'm up to. This is
one of those times.

You've probably already noticed the sharing buttons at the bottom of
every post. I am trying out the ShareThis platform so that you can
quickly and easily send anything you see here to your social network(s)
of choice, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ (which I adore).

If you aren't on any social networks, or your friends aren't, you can
click the very first button, the "share" button, and send a link via
normal old e-mail. Yes, we have reached the point in our technological
growth where e-mail is both "normal" and "old."

In any case, I merely wanted to point out that this new feature is in no
way a scam or trick of any kind. I will not gain access to your Facebook
Wall or be able to read your Google+ Stream, I will only be able to see
statistics on how many people shared things and how many people clicked
on your shared items, which is helpful for me to see what's popular and
what I should write more about.

If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below.
