Today we wrapped up our â€œColonial Cape Codâ€? workshop (Iâ€™m writing
this in our little Radisson hotel room, just about to pack up and
leave). Hereâ€™s a peek at Chris and one of our workshop participants
admiring a pretty nice sunset on the National Seashore (taken with my
15mm fisheye lens):

As the sun got lower, the sky got even more interesting. Hereâ€™s one of
the keepers from that group that I can show off because itâ€™s my blog
so I get to subject you to whatever I want:

Coming up, weâ€™ve got a really cool workshop in [Acadia National
Park](http://artphotoworkshops.com/workshop/2009/October/Acadia) in Maine
(thatâ€™s October 16th through 18th), and then in November weâ€™ll be
doing yet another one-day Boston workshop if anyone wants to walk around
the freezing streets of Beantown and pick up some tips.
