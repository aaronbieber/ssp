I went back to Mohegan Park after being told that there was an
"abandoned zoo" on the premises. I didn't recall seeing what might pass
as a zoo, but I had to go check it out anyway. As a bonus, it was a
beautifully warm day and there can be no excuse for not going outside
and enjoying it. ~~MORE~~

With these two, I was experimenting with the tip I gave you on
Wednesday. I set my auto-focus point to the one on the far right, which
at first can feel a bit strange, but it does force the composition to be
somewhat more interesting.

The first one here is with the 24-70mm f/2.8 (at 70mm), and the second
is using the Sigma 105mm macro (a very fine lens, if I do say so
myself).
