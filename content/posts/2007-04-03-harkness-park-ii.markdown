  content: I'm going to do another Photoshop tutorial based on that tree photograph
    because I used another neat technique I've been working on. Keep an eye out for
    it! Glad you like it :)

More photos from Harkness Memorial State Park. I'm playing with some new
Photoshop techniques (and still giving Lightroom a run for its money),
so I'll be posting more specifically about that later. Perhaps another
tutorial? We'll see!
