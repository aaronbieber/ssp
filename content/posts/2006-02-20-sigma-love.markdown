I've been putzing around with my Sigma 105mm f/2.8 macro lately. The
lens is no longer being made, but is widely regarded as performing
better than Canon's basic lenses (not quite to L standards, though), and
is a bargain and a half if you can find one. The AF motor is loud and
slow, but the image quality is tops.
