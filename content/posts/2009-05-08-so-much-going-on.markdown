It's been quite a hiatus for me and for Single-Serving Photo. My last
post here was back in February, and so much has happened since then!
First of all, if you're reading this, thank you for not deleting me from
your feed reader or taking me off of your bookmarks list. I know I
haven't been the chatterbox I once was, but I don't like to post link
wrap-ups and two-sentence thought fragments just for the sake of putting
something online.

Anyway, _on with the show_!

First things first, *JPG Magazine is back*! After being effectively
shut down due to budget and business problems, JPG has resuscitated
itself mostly thanks to the outpouring of support from its community and
highly visible demonstrations such as [savejpg.com](http://savejpg.com)
which presumably gave investors the confidence they needed to pump more
necessary capital into the parent company of JPG Magazine, 8020 Media.

Now that JPG has risen from the dead, maybe I'll actually contribute
something! You should, too.

Second, my little hands-on instruction business,
[ArtPhotoWorkshops.com](http://artphotoworkshops.com) is going to be
doing a series of low-cost, short "photo-walk" workshops in the New
England area. Starting with [Cape
Cod](http://artphotoworkshops.com/workshop/2009/May/CapeCod) in a week
and then [Boston](http://artphotoworkshops.com/workshop/2009/June/Boston)
after that, I plan to take us out to Newport, Rhode Island, possibly
Northampton, Massachusetts, maybe even out to the [Quabbin
Reservoir](http://en.wikipedia).org/wiki/Quabbin_Reservoir for the
nature lovers.

If there are places you'd like to explore and learn technique,
composition, and mechanics of photography, leave a comment and I'll see
if we can visit them!

I just returned from Las Vegas and Death Valley on a workshop, no photos
to show yet, but I think it was an extremely successful trip. Death
Valley is by far one of America's most impressive sights, I recommend
seeing it once in your life (or if you're crazy like me, twice). Las
Vegas is a very challenging location to photograph, but I think I was
able to snag at least a small number of cool images in between games of
craps and tall beers!

There are a few other cool things I want to share, so stay tuned for
kite photography, painting with a car, and my opinions on both.
