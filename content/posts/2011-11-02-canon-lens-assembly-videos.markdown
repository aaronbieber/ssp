A while back I posted that cool video of how a Leica lens is
hand-assembled. At the time I mentioned that I've never owned nor even
used a Leica lens but that I respected the craftsmanship and care with
which they are put together.

It occurred to me back then that I had, indeed, seen videos of Canon
lenses being assembled (specifically their "L" series; I am not sure if
the non-L lenses are hand-assembled or not) but I didn't have the
presence of mind to go find them.

Because I'm still mostly a Canon devotee I thought it wise to catch up
with that thought and post these behind-the-scenes videos of a Canon "L"
lens being assembled, yes, by hand. Truly it is a marvel of engineering
and of manual dexterity at some points. Hopefully if you, too, are a
Canon shooter, these videos will give you even more respect for the
product you likely hold in such high regard.

This is a three-part series and takes you all the way from "how do we
make sand into a lens" to "this is how we put the barrel together."
