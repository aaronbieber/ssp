There was a time, long ago, when photographs were conceived at the
moment the shutter button was depressed. Darkroom techniques were
limited at best (the idea that a photographic image could even be
created was a modern miracle) and the photographer was required to make
near-perfect exposures every time.

Things have changed a lot since then; it's now possible to do amazing
things long after the light has been captured by the camera. Today I'm
going to explore some competing points of view and take a philosophical
walk through the annals of photographic history to clear up some
improper perceptions of digital post-processing.~~MORE~~

## First, Some History

The first commercially viable photographic technology was the
[Daguerrotype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerrotype), a
positive-only process (no negative is created and each image can only be
made once) resulting in extremely fragile prints on copper plates.

Not only was the development and printing process inflexible and time
consuming, but it also exposed photographers to chemicals such as
mercury and iodine; not the kinds of things you want to be _boiling_
and possibly _inhaling_!

Over time, photographic technology evolved. The system of using silver
halide-based negatives emerged, allowing photographers to make more than
one print from each of their images; prints that could be handled
without fear of destroying them. The printing process itself was
transformed from a cumbersome operation using metal substrates and
boiling chemicals to the more refined and less hazardous procedure we
use today.

It was the invention of the glass negative (circa 1839, possibly by John
Herschel, an astronomer by trade (Edit: It was brought to my attention that
Herschel wasn't responsible for the "invention" of the negative, although he
probably coined the term. For more information about this stage in photography's
early development, read about
[William Fox Talbot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fox_Talbot),
[John Herschel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel), and the
[wet plate collodion process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodion)) that
precipitated the institution of photographic post-processing. The negative
expanded the photographic process into three steps, which should look very
familiar:

* Exposure
* Development
* Printing

Post-processing, by definition, is altering the image *after* the light has been
captured (hence, _post-_). Traditionally, these alterations were achieved by
modifying the way the exposed film was developed into a negative and the way the
negative was printed. For the first time, photographers had the ability to
enhance their images beyond the capacity of the film materials of the day;
dodging and burning, for example, can create images with a tonal range beyond
what can be captured by the film at exposure time.

As photographic technology and techniques surge forward, the photographer is
given a progressively more expansive collection of post-processing tools and
abilities. Digital photography has completed the transformation of
post-processing into an art form unto itself, based concretely on captured-light
imagery but possessing all of the characteristics and nuances of a full-fledged
medium. Regardless of its flexibility and capabilities, is it not still bound to
photography?

## Artistic Integrity

{% random left %}

Any debate over whether post-processing invalidates the artistic integrity of a
photographic work is fundamentally academic. Even before chemical photography
existed, artists used camera-like devices such as the _camera obscura_ or
optical contraptions like the _camera lucida_ to trace a three-dimensional scene
onto paper. Chemical photography and highly sensitive film materials simply
permitted artists to capture their subjects faster and with greater accuracy,
but never excused an artist from laying hands upon the entire process to reach
their artistic goals. Never in the evolution of darkroom techniques was the
final product's status as a photograph questioned.

A perception exists that the medium of captured-light images is pure, not to be
spoiled by the meddling of non-optical tools. It may be that the last few
decades of photography, during which no paradigm shifts in traditional process
have occurred ((Digital photography is unquestionably a paradigm shift, but the
idea of collecting light through a lens, capturing the resulting image, and
reproducing that image on paper is exactly the same as it was when the term
"photography" was first conceived in 1832.)), are responsible for this
notion. Or, it may be that the digital world is so vastly different--not in
essence, but in physicality--from the world of the darkroom that this discussion
has arisen.

{% random right %}

Still, there are those who perceive an imaginary line in post-processing across
which a photograph passes into a different state of being and loses its status
as a photograph. To me, this distinction is purely semantic. We could debate the
definition of "photograph" _ad infinitum_ and never reach a consensus. What does
this discussion do for any of us as artists?

Far be it from me to make sweeping generalizations about a field as personal and
subjective as art, but I feel as though the detractors of post-processing are
the antithesis of its very spirit. Let me explain.

## The Question of Intent

You could say that a watercolor splattered with acrylic ceases to be a
watercolor. Semantically, that's true enough; I think that the world of art
would classify such a painting as "mixed media." Perhaps the stumbling block in
digital photography is the inextricable relationship between its traditional
light-capture methods and the digital "development" tools that make even its
most modest creations possible.

{% random left %}

Because traditional darkroom development tools have always been part and parcel
to the process we call "photography," even since the earliest days of its
existence, it's hard to suggest that they are separate mediums or separate forms
of art. I contend that digital photography is no different. A digital
photographer may not use chemical developers or optical enlargers, but the
process is fundamentally the same. Those who claim otherwise tend to draw the
line at a subjective point in the editing process, one which marks no meaningful
boundary.

Rather than introducing entirely new mechanics or technology, digital
post-processing of any degree makes use of the same fundamental operations that
produce simple and austere works. Because the tools are the same, it is the
methods themselves, the intricacies of the artist's process, that are called
into question; something that has never happened in photography before,
certainly not to this degree.

What do you think? Are there Photoshop filters or third-party software tools or
certain editing techniques that transform a photograph into a
photographically-derived work, not deserving of the name "photograph?"  Where do
you draw the line?

*I think that it's an artist's duty to carefully examine each viewpoint
in this discussion and then promptly ignore them all.*
