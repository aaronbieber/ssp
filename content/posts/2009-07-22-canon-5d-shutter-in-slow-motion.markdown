If there is anything in the world I like more than slow motion,
itâ€™sâ€¦ I have no idea, I love slow motion so much. I am completely
addicted to that Discovery Channel show [Time
Warp](http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/time-warp/time-warp).html and I
frequently search for [slow
motion](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=slow+motion&search_type=&aq=f)
on YouTube and just watch everything that comes up (anything from
Brainiacs is usually awesome).

For your daily dose of photography-related slow motion, I bring you a
video of the Canon 5D shutter shot at 2,000 frames per second using
(allegedly) a Phantom HD high speed camera.
