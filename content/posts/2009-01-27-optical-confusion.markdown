Okay, so I missed the boat on this by a little bit, but I think it bears
discussion anyway. Earlier this month, an exhibition came to a close at
the Yale University Art Gallery called "First Doubt: Optical Confusion
in Modern Photography." Optical confusion refers to that effect you get
when you look at something and it isn't immediately apparent what it is.
The reaction is best when the subject matter is common and well-known,
but portrayed in an unusual or misleading way.

For example, the photo to the right (which is from the aforementioned
show) depicts a man's chin, neck, chest, and part of his leg. The
contrast and cropping, though, make it compositionally more interesting
and somewhat more difficult to "figure out," visually. I wouldn't
suggest that you run about photographing things in ways that nobody can
ever puzzle out, or that high art must in some way be confounding to the
general public, but you must admit that a composition that makes you
scratch your head for a moment is going to hold your interest for that
much longer.

The idea of optical confusion is (clearly) not new. I'm sure you've all
seen the classic young woman/old woman illusion (shown at left), which,
once you visually map out both images, seems to randomly flip-flop
between the two in the mind's eye. In photographic composition, this
technique of close-cropping and creatively limiting the viewer's
understanding of what they are looking at can be a very powerful tool.

Take, for example, the image below (by Karin Rosenthal, "Belly
Landscape," 1980â€”which I snagged from [The Online
Photographer](http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/01/in-photography.html)).
When I first saw the image, I really thought it was a landscape; some
sort of Adams-esque river valley. Of course by stating the title of the
piece I've pretty much blown the lid on that optical illusion, but if
you squint you can probably see it as a river valley again.

Certainly the specific genre of "body landscapes" is one with its fair
share of avid creators, and it would be challenging now to forge new
territory (no pun intended) within that space. Nevertheless, we can all
take a cue from the clever way that the image misleads the eye.

The next time you're out photographing or sitting in front of Lightroom
(you do use Lightroom, right?), think about how you might add tension
and interest to a composition through creative cropping, eliminating
some of the most recognizable elements from a subject. Just a small
tweak is all it may take to transform a solid, representative image into
a thoroughly engaging work of optical confusion.

containing selections from the collection used in the Yale University
Art Museum show.
