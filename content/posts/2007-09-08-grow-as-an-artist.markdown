There are three major ways to grow as an artist; to strengthen your aesthetic
senses and the quality of your work:

* *Emulate* the work of artists you admire,

* *Experiment* on your own, exploring the subject matter that interests you, and

* Participate in *critique*

Emulation is very common, especially when getting started in art, and exploring
subject matter of interest to you essentially describes _doing_ art, so I'm sure
you do that already. *Critique, however, is where many artists are
weakest.*~~MORE~~

Participating in critique means two things: evaluating the work of others and
considering others' evaluations of your work.

For the most part, valuable critique will be given to you by people at or above
your level of artistic accomplishment. The reason I say this is because people
at different levels of accomplishment may express their ideas in different ways,
and the closer someone is to your level of accomplishment, the better you'll be
able to understand where they're coming from.

Participating in critique necessitates the use of some artistic
vocabulary. Critique is only useful if it can be understood, so being able to
express yourself in artistic terms is an important skill for growing your
abilities. A great resource for expanding your artistic vocabulary is the very
thorough [ArtLex Art Dictionary](http://www.artlex.com). There you will learn
that color, for example, can be described as "saturated, clear, cool, warm,
deep, subdued, grayed, tawny, mat, glossy, monochrome, multicolored,
particolored, variegated, or polychromed." Knowing what these kinds of words
mean will help you to be much more expressive in your critiques.

In photography specifically, there is no better site
than [PhotoSIG](http://www.photosig.com) for participating in critique.
PhotoSIG's critique system is built in such a way that it encourages thoughtful
feedback and rewards posts that the artist finds helpful. On top of that, the
community is very large so nearly all work receives decent exposure, and there
is a whole lot of talent to tap into. I highly recommend signing up for a free
account and critiquing some photographs there.

You can read some critiques that I've written on PhotoSIG by
visiting
[my photo critiques page](http://www.photosig.com/go/users/userphotocritiques?id=146708)

[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) has a nice comment system built into it, but
because it isn't geared toward formal critique, it isn't quite as effective at
generating thoughtful, useful feedback. The best places on Flickr to solicit
critique are the various "groups" created by certain photography groups and
geared toward artistic growth in particular.  Naturally,
the [Strobist.com Flickr group](http://flickr.com/groups/strobist/) is a good
place to start, though Strobist deals chiefly with off-camera flash images, so
don't try to get feedback on your landscape work there.

There are a few Flickr groups specifically for sharing critique, among
them
[Photography Critique](http://flickr.com/groups/photographycritique/),
[The Photo Critique Forum](http://flickr.com/groups/photocritiqueforum/),
and [Critique](http://flickr.com/groups/critique/). I didn't spend much time
reading through them, but they each have hundreds of members, and hey, it's
free.

Happy critiquing!
