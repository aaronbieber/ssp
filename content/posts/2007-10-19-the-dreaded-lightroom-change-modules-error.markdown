  content: "Hey Aaron -\n\nI'm having the same issue in LR (\"an error occurred when
    changing modules\").  It appears to have started after I upgraded to OS X 10.5
    last weekend.  I get the error when I click on the \"Print\" module in LR.  All
    other modules seem to work okay.  \n\nI've re-installed the print driver (Pixma
    Pro 9000)...re-installed LR... tried the rename-the-Lightroom-folder trick you
    mentioned...STILL no luck!  I was hoping you might have some other ideas.\n\nThanks!\nCharley"

    ...update to last post...

    I revised my search and found this:  http://www.lightroomforums.net/showthread.php?t=330

    It appears LR 1.2 is not fully compatible with OS X 10.5!!!

    From the blog:
    Per Tom's blog, "The current version of Lightroom 1.2 is not fully compatible with Leopard, Mac OS X 10.5. The good news is that weâ€™ll be releasing an update in mid-November that will address key compatibility issues." One of the known issues is that the Print module may not load. For the full blog: http://blogs.adobe.com/lightroomjour...d_leopard.html.

    In a weird way, I'm relieved by this answer.  At least I know to stop chasing the issue.  Plus, I can always print from CS3.

    I'm not very happy with Adobe at the moment, thanks to both this Lightroom 1.2 news from Charley as well as my [poor experience with Photoshop CS3](/articles/2007/10/17/photoshop-cs3-overrated/). It looks rather certain that I'll stick with Tiger for at least the rest of this month (even though I have a Leopard DVD on its way to me as I write this).

    C'mon Adobe, get with the program!

  content: Hate to say it, but I'm running LR 1.3 and on 10.4.11 of OSX. I printed
    loads of pictures yesterday, but today it's not letting me into the Print module
    at all. There's plenty of drive space, and nothing...but nothing, has been updated.
    This is really, really frustrating!

    Sorry to hear about your troubles, Kev. I did bite the bullet and upgrade to 10.5 (Leopard, actually 10.5.1) and I'm running Lightroom 1.3 and my "Print" module does seem to be working. I admit, I don't use the print module much, but I tried it once and saw the convenience it brings, especially for contact sheets and such.

    I'm slightly disappointed at how slowly Adobe seems to react to things like these. I have a much more serious problem with Leopard and Photoshop CS 3, which I also wrote about. That still has not been resolved, so I'm using CS 2 instead.

    Lightroom is a great product, but so is Aperture. I have a lot of time invested in Lightroom and I would like to keep it, but if push came to shove, I have options.

    Photoshop is at the place in its lifespan where it has become seriously entrenched and is depended upon by millions. If I couldn't use Photoshop, I'm really not sure where I would turn. I hope that Adobe can get their act together and fix the problems it has in Leopard because hardware and OS development isn't going to stop any time soon!

    Thanks for sharing your troubles, Kev. If you do get it figured out, please leave another comment so everyone can benefit!

  content: Well, I thought I'd write in this area since Adobe is so slow and limited
    in their forum and knowledgebase searches.  I trialed their version 1.3 and, to
    my utter disappointment, still have no export abilities for background music.  I
    assume they are limited by Acrobat's inability to play music.  Well, I let the
    trial lapse and then went back to the folders that it had imported (I was missing
    images that I knew I should have had).  I looked at these particular folders Lightroom
    had set up and found that the X3F files had 0 kb's!  That was 127 images that
    were not imported.  When you are importing 100's and 1,000's of images, you might
    just not notice that the files have "0" listed in the registered image!  Now that
    the app has lapsed, I can't go in to see if there is, at least, a thumbnail ghost
    or another place where the file might have been sequestered.  This is not as painful
    as my iPhoto experience of losing thumbnails and thinking I had lost the originals
    and, in my panic, accidentally deleting an original file of thousands.  But, it
    would have been disconcerting if I had shelled out the $300 and found later that
    these files had been registered as X3F files with no content!  Any suggestions?  Like,
    kiss them off or hasta la toaster, baby!?!

    Thank you so much for this article, it fixed all my Lightroom issues! I know I'm a couple years late, but it did the trick.
    Thanks again!

If you've been using Adobe Lightroom since Beta 1, as I have, and if
you're using a Mac, there is a very good chance that you've run into the
_awful_ "change modules" error. This error usually strikes when your
catalog is being updated during a version upgrade, when other Adobe
software on your computer changes, or for any number of other unrelated
reasons (as I discovered).

What happens is roughly this: you open the program and the splash screen
remains indefinitely. If you click it, it disappears, but Lightroom's
main window does not open. You receive a very minimal menu bar including
"Lightroom," "File," "Edit," and perhaps "Window." The File menu is
shortened and only allows you to open a catalog. I presume that this is
what Lightroom would look like if you could put it into a state where it
has no catalog open. During normal operation, you basically always have
a catalog open.

Once there, you can try to open your catalog, but as soon as you do, you
will receive the error: "An error occurred when attempting to change
modules." Feel free to click OK on that message, it will simply drop you
into a weird, incomplete Lightroom interface that has no side panels and
no film strip.

Having battled this error two different times now, I am confident I can
offer some advice.~~MORE~~

The first time I encountered this error was in Lightroom 1.1. I normally
import my photos using Image Capture so they receive custom icons (Image
Capture's cool like that) and I had just finished importing a big batch
from a recent trip up to Boston. Opening Lightroom, I received the
Terrible Module Error and the incomplete Lightroom interface that I
might be tempted to call "the gray screen of death." At first I had a
panic attack because I've put so much into my Lightroom catalog since
Beta 1. I have so much metadata it hurts to think about losing it.

Reinstallation of the software is usually step number one when this type
of thing happens, and it's one of the most widely suggested remedies on
the Adobe User-to-User Forums and on the one or two Flickr discussion
threads where it has come up. Between you and me, it doesn't work. I've
been through this error twice and both times I faced it, reinstalling
the software _a few times_ didn't solve it. But it can't hurt, right?

If you want to reinstall Lightroom all over again, here is what you have
to do:

* Delete the Lightroom application. Go into your Applications folder,
drag Lightroom to the trash, and empty the trash. Or, if you're a slick
keyboard nerd, select Lightroom and press Command-Delete (that's the key
that old-schoolers call "backspace'). Don't forget to empty the trash
either way.
 * Delete the Lightroom preferences file. Go into your home folder,
then into Library -&gt; Preferences, and delete
@com.adobe.Lightroom.plist@ from within it using one of the methods
above.
 * For giggles, you can also delete the Lightroom support folder if you
want, which is located in home -&gt; Library -&gt; Application Support
-&gt; Adobe -&gt; Lightroom.
 * Last, but definitely not least, you need to delete the installation
receipt, which is what tells the Lightroom installer that the software
is already installed. It will _not_ let you reinstall it if it finds
the receipt. Open up your hard drive then open Library -&gt; Receipts
and delete @Adobe Photoshop Lightroom.pkg@.

Once you've done all that and your trash is empty, you can install the
software again. But like I said, it's probably not going to help you.

The first time I solved this problem, it was a stroke of luck. I had
reinstalled the software a couple of times to no avail and I was getting
to the end of my leash. Each time, however, I installed version 1.0 off
of my retail CD and then immediately upgraded to 1.1 using the
downloaded upgrade app. Eventually I got a clue and figured I'd try
installing 1.0 and actually _running it_ before upgrading just to see
what would happen. So I did that and I got an _entirely different_
error. This time it said "There isn't sufficient hard drive space for
Lightroom to open" or something like that.

*OH REALLY*.

Sure enough, importing my last batch of photos completely filled my hard
drive. Once I fixed that problem by deleting a bunch of really bad
music, the error went away and I was back up and running with version
1.1. This is a symptom of pretty bad error trapping by Adobe's
development team. Obviously the hard drive being full caused some type
of exception, but rather than that error bubbling up to the GUI level,
it proceeded to cause a cascade of problems until the very last issue
was reported to me, which had to do with changing modules.

That would be like going to the doctor and having him tell you that your
eyes are red because of sinus pressure or something. That's interesting
and all, but wouldn't it be better if he could tell you that your eyes
are red because you have sinus pressure, which is because you _have a
cold_? That makes it a bit easier to treat the problem, wouldn't you
say?

It seems to me that the main reason why this error is seen so often and
in so many varying situations is because it's the very last thing that
goes wrong in nearly every chain of exceptions within the software. Bad
exception handling.

Okay, that's all well and good, but I did have this happen to me again
(last night, actually). This time it was version 1.2 I was using and
this time my hard drive was clearly not full. I even double-checked it.
So, once again I hit Google to try to find out what other sorts of
problems people have had. There is remarkably little to be found on this
issue. I did find some interesting suggestions, but none of them worked
for me.

I had messed around a lot with installing different versions of
Photoshop and the Creative Suite (as I mentioned in my recent article
[Photoshop CS3:
Overrated](/articles/2007/10/17/photoshop-cs3-overrated/))
and figured that all of that activity with related Adobe software
probably messed up some files somewhere. So, I performed one of the
tests outlined by someone on the Adobe forums.

I created a new user on my system, granting them administrator rights,
and I logged into their account and ran Lightroom. It ran! This narrowed
the problem down to something in my local home directory because both
users were administrators and had access to every other file on the
system. So, I copied the Lightroom preferences file and a couple of
other files from the new user's Library folder into my own Library
folder, hoping that it would solve the problem. No such luck. Back to
the drawing board.

Having no other apparent course of action, I searched out and deleted
every single Adobe-related file on my entire computer. I wiped it all
out completely.

I even _restarted_, which I really think is unnecessary, and installed
Lightroom for only the fourth or fifth time that night. _And I got the
same error_! By that time I was getting pretty desperate. The one thing
I hadn't tried was messing with my actual catalog files. I was very
apprehensive about touching them because, well, they're my
_lifeblood_.

What I did was, I renamed my whole Lightroom folder to @Lightroom.old@
and started it up. *BAM*, it created a new, empty, default catalog and
opened like a champ. Go figure. With the program still open, I deleted
the Lightroom folder and renamed @Lightroom.old@ back to @Lightroom@.
Then I was able to go through File -&gt; Open and open my actual catalog
and guess what? It worked.

There is something tremendously fishy about this whole situation, but I
hope that my experience with it will help folks out there who have run
across this problem and spent late nights banging their heads against
their desks as I did.

If you have run into this problem, solved it, or not solved it, leave a
comment!
