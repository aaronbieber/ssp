It's been so long since I've been able to get anything online! My
esteemed colleague, Heather, has been keeping the site afloat with her
much more frequent postings and for that I must give her a tip of my
hat.

Here are some neat photos I took while I was bored one afternoon with my
little PowerShot SD110. I was throwing it up in the air with a
one-second shutter speed just to see what would happen.
