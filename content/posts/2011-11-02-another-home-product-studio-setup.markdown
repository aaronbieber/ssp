I've posted about this before, but there is something so romantic about
being able to do professional-looking product photography right in your
kitchen and sharing the images with the Internet at large and watching
them fumble all over themselves to figure out which studio you hired.

This is essentially the culmination of the progressively tumbling costs
of photography equipment and exploding mindshare of innovators on the
Internet. There are now low-cost solutions to problems that were
insurmountable to the layman until only a few years ago and we have not
only the actual photographic technology to thank for that, but also
sites like _handmade spark_, who provide marketing advice to Etsy
sellers.

I won't delve too deeply into what Etsy is for anyone who may not know
because it's a bit beyond the reach of my topic here, but it is a
marketplace of sorts, and thus it benefits greatly from well-executed
product photography.

In any case, _handmade spark_ posted an article about how to set up a
really simple aluminum foil reflector setup that uses natural light to
illuminate your (small) product subject and when I saw it I immediately
thought (I'm really not kidding), _This is exactly the kind of stuff my
SSP audience would love to see_.

This is miles beyond the whole Strobist crowd with their SB800s and
their watt-seconds and their multiple white balances. There is a time
and a place for off-camera flash, but check this out... We are lighting
a product on our kitchen tables with aluminum foil-wrapped cardboard and
we are getting _sweet results_.

Alright, I feel as though I've gushed about this enough. Read it for
yourself: [Studio Quality Product Photography with a \$12 Set
