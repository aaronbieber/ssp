There is a very well-kept cemetery in Bloomfield called Mountain View.
It sort of sounds like the name of a convalescent home, but perhaps
that's appropriate. In any case, it really is on a mountain and it
really does have a splendid view.

Even the cell phone towers look dramatic and cool.

Looks even more awesome in silhouette, doesn't he?

Finally, dusk reflected in a headstone.
