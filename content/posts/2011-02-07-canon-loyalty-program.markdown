  content: thank you i have just the camera for the job

Sometimes I feel like a shill when I talk about these sales and deals,
but it's so hard for me to look at a fabulous bargain and not pass it
on. Such is the case with the so-called _Canon Loyalty Program_, which
is apparently Canon's way of saying "thank you" for buying one of their
point-and-shoot cameras.

I found this on the venerable deal-hunting site "FatWallet," and if you
like you can [read the original post
yourself](http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/hot-deals/849344/). Basically,
if you have a qualifying Canon digital camera (it has to be digital and
it's really limited to point-and-shoot models), _even if it doesn't
work anymore_, you can trade it in for a refurbished white-box
replacement at a pretty reasonable discount.

If you have an out-of-warranty Canon point-and-shoot and you were
thinking of upgrading it, this could be an opportunity to save a little
cash, which is something everyone could probably stand to do right now.

Read the fully detailed summary of the program [on the FatWallet
forum](http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/hot-deals/849344/.)
