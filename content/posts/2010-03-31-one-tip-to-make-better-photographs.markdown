  content: You're right about equipment and the temptation to think it will take the
    place of technique and vision. Permit me to disagree about the indredible iPhone
    photos. Some are very good and show a great eye for the moment but "incredible"?

    Fair point, Dan, it's a matter of personal opinion of course. Nevertheless, for cell phone photographs, I think what many of them have achieved is fairly incredible, and moreover a good number of them are no better than what one might expect from a "real" camera, aside from the lower resolution.

    I would even venture to say that developing one's "eye" using such limited equipment puts the emphasis precisely where it belongs: on the shot, which is the real point I'm trying to make when I say stop buying gear.

    Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

    Great Post.

    Sometimes we tricked by consumerism into thinking we NEED more and more in order to keep producing stunning images.

    I've seen truly amazing images from pinhole cameras, nothing but a cardboard box!

    We need be reminded to strip back the lenses, filters, latest technology and remember that we see with our eyes and heart.

    Cheers,
    Chris

![Too many
cameras!](/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Many-cameras-300x175.jpg "Too many cameras!")

On the long, long road to artistic enlightenment, one is beset on all
sides by the temptations of fast advancement, of turn-key improvements
that will catapult you, the artist, to new heights and new levels of
quality. Sometimes these temptations are valid and justifiable and
sometimes they're not.

The most often encountered temptation on the road to artistic
enlightenment in digital photography is _equipment_. Oh yes, all of
that _delicious tech_, how we love it so. If you've been shooting
national parks and you just can't seem to capture that "Ansel Adams
look" that you're after, you might think, _Hey, maybe \$600 in high-end
rectangular glass gradient filters is the key to my woes!_ And
truthfully, it could be...

*But probably not.*

There is only one piece of advice I can give you that will help you to
simultaneously improve your photographs and to save money on all of that
equipment you keep drooling over in the B&H catalog...<!--more-->

Stop buying equipment.

I'm serious, actually stop buying equipment. How much equipment do you
have? How much more do you think you need to make truly great
photographs? I suppose it depends on what you're photographing, but here
is a list of essential equipment that everyone should have:

* A camera (duh?)
 * One decent zoom lens somewhere in the range of 15-200mm (24-70,
24-105, 16-35, 70-200, etc.)
 * A quality, sturdy tripod
 * A reliable, well-made ball head
 * A bag to carry stuff in (optional)

The bag doesn't even have to be an actual _camera bag_; I've seen
professionals--and I mean seasoned, no-holds-barred, money-is-no-object
pros--carrying cameras around in fanny packs, hiking backpacks, you name
it. Whatever works for you.

Any gear you buy after that is likely to be something you _want_. I'm
not saying that's wrong, either; I certainly love equipment and there is
absolutely a time and a place for a 10-stop ND filter or that cool new
hot shoe flash or that cutting edge lens that was just released, and so
on.

So what is wrong with buying equipment, then? Buying equipment because
you think you need it to get to the "next level" of your work is,
generally speaking, untrue. Want some evidence? [Here are hundreds of
incredible photos taken with
iPhones](http://www.thebestcamera.com/popular.html). It doesn't really
get a whole lot more low-tech than a 3-megapixel, fixed-focal-length
cell phone camera... Which has horrendous low-light performance, I might
add.

Can an iPhone create the kind of tack-sharp, wide-angle, color-rich
images you're trying to create? No, probably not. You need at least some
level of decent equipment to get to where you want to be, but nine times
out of ten you don't have to go any further than the list at the top of
this article.

So before you load up [B&H's awesome website](http://bhphotovideo.com) to
pick up the current focus of your technolust... Go out and take a few
photos. Of anything. Because practice makes perfect and there is no
substitute for real-world experience.
