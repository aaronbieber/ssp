Prior to driving to work this morning I caught a glimpse of some of this
typically bacheloresque trash laying about and making a graphic
composition of itself. You get down with your bad self, Rolling Rock.
You _get down_.

As I was driving in I endangered many lives to capture this and several
other _shifting one-handed and photographing out the window_ shots.

Then I parked and this just *happened*.

I can't complain.
