I received another e-mail from the (former) Editor in Chief of JPG
Magazine yesterday announcing that JPG isn't quite dead. Here is the
full message:

> We couldn't ask for a better community. In the week or so since our
> last email, the outpour of support has exceeded our wildest
> expectations. Your efforts, such as starting savejpg.com, writing blog
> posts, commenting on Twitter and Flickr, and generally making your
> voices heard, have provided exciting new opportunities for us.
>
> We're thrilled to say that because of you, we have multiple credible
> buyers interested in giving JPG a home. We will be keeping the site up
> after all, and hope to have a final update in the next week or so on
> who the acquirer will be. Thank you for making all of this possible.

> Laura Brunow Miner
>  Editor in Chief
