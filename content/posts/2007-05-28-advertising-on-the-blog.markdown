As you have probably noticed by now, I've decided to place some of those
Google text ads on my article pages. Now, I know what you're probably
thinking, and it's something like, _Great, now I have to wade through
six feet of ads for genital cream before I get to the photos!_ So
before you all jump ship, I want to assure you that I will never allow
ads to move into a position that compromises the readability of my site.

Right now, ads are only appearing on the single article pages to allow
Google's _AdSense thingy_ (that's the technical term) to give you more
relevant ads. The point, of course, is that hopefully there'll be an ad
for something that genuinely looks interesting and two things will
happen: 1) you will find out more about it, and 2) I will get
approximately a penny. But hey, one hundred of those and I can buy 1/3
of a gallon of gas, right?!

As always, I am open to feedback about this and all other changes to
Single-Serving Photo. At the end of the day I'm providing a service to
you, my readers, and so I must respect your opinions. At the same time,
someone's gotta pay all the virtual hosting bills!
