[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/google-daguerre-300x162.png "Google's Louis Daguerre Logo (Thumb)")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/google_daguerre.png)

Today is Louis Daguerre's birthday, and Google is helping to celebrate
it by devoting their logo to him. Happy 224th, buddy!

Wait, are you really about to ask me who Louis Daguerre was? Hey, it's
OK, to be fair the guy has been dead for about 160 years... Even so, in
this line of work I sort of expected more from you. Maybe you've heard
the word _Daguerreotype_ before? Even my browser spell-checker knows
that word. That's right, it's a photographic process; that's probably
close enough for most tabletop trivia games.

Unfortunately, this blog is not interested in tidbits of trivia, so get
ready for facts. Lots of facts. With historical _context_. ~~MORE~~

Returning to the topic at hand, Daguerre's eponymous method was the
first silver-based imaging process and one of the first techniques for
creating a photographic image _ever_. So before you start wagging your
tongue and making noises that sound like "why does this guy deserve a
Google logo?", remember that Louis has done more for photography than
all of your hiking through the backwoods of Yosemite with a full-frame
digital SLR has ever done. Or will ever do, because you are not an
inventor. Seriously, assembling an IKEA coffee table is not the same
thing as inventing something.

Poor, poor Louis Daguerre. He might have lived longer if making a
Daguerreotype didn't involve boiling mercury until its steam envelops a
copper plate treated with iodine vapor. Yes, the Daguerreotype was the
first commercially viable photographic process, but it was also a great
way to accidentally poison yourself and die. Like that one popular song
put it, "Shake it, shake it... Shake it like a poisonous picture..." No,
hang on, that doesn't sound right... Either way, iodine vapor and
boiling mercury are among the worst things to get all over your hands
and face, and this was _the eighteen thirties_. You think they had
respirators and fume hoods back then? (For trivia buffs: they did not).

Anyway, flip the calendar back a bit and meet Nicephore Niepce (born
Joseph Niepce), a French inventor with a totally unpronounceable name
who had been fiddling with photographic reproduction since 1793. You
see, Niepce liked to reproduce engravings, and the way you reproduced an
image in the late 18th century was to point a _camera obscura_ at it
and trace the projected image. Niepce had an unsteady hand and couldn't
trace the images well, so he set about his search for a chemical process
that might capture the light from the projection.

Ultimately, he was successful, and Niepce is acknowledged by historians
as the creator of the first ever photographic image, but his lavender
oil-based process (now called "heliography") had plenty of issues. Like,
you know, the eight-hour exposure time. "Please hold still, Madam. Just
another six hours." This is why he only made images of other art or of
landscapes. Things that generally hold still all day long.

Niepce began collaborating with artist Louis Daguerre in 1829. After
Niepce's death in 1833, Daguerre continued their work and eventually
created the Daguerreotype, a process hardly resembling heliography in
method and which overcame many of its challenges. So good was this
process that Daguerre was able to _sell it_ to the _French
government_ in return for a stipend of 6,000 Francs each year _for the
rest of his life_. Laughing all the way to the bank, Daguerre went down
in history as the inventor of the first photographic method that
produced results of any lasting value, and Daguerreotypes from that
period remain intact to this day, even in spite of their fragility.

In fairness, Daguerre got the French government to give Niepce's estate
4,000 Francs a year for his contribution to the development of the
process, so it wasn't as though he stole _all_ the glory, although
Niepce never got a Google logo dedicated to him. That, I feel, is the
true measure of one's significance within the larger tapestry of
history; has Google recognized your contributions by commissioning a
logo in your honor that will appear on their main page for one day? No?
Then you are nothing.

In that respect, Louis Daguerre joins the ranks of such other
consequential people as Charles Darwin, Marie Curie, Fyodor Dostoevsky,
and Earth Day. OK, so Earth Day isn't a person, it's my blog and I like
Earth Day so sue me.

The next time you pick up your fancy shmancy digital camera to go out
and take 4,000 photographs in an afternoon, I want you to remember M.
Louis Daguerre and his iodine- and mercury-coated hands that labored for
many hours to create a single image on a copper plate, and who couldn't
even share it on Flickr, because he didn't have a computer.
