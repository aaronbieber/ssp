My headline might be a bit of an overstatement, but digital photography
stands closer than ever to forcing out film as the number one choice
among new photographers. In fact, I might go so far as to say that
digital _is_ the number one choice among new photographers, though
that doesn't mean that film has become obsolete.

It's more important than ever for photographers to be aware of what's
happening in the digital world as today's youngest generation of
photographers enter the scene and wonder why anyone ever got their hands
wet while making images.~~MORE~~

Film photography and chemical development processes are steeped in
history and wield the power of a mature, extremely well understood
craft. Today's students, however, will experience less and less of that
"traditional" methodology as digital takes center stage.

Some college students may never be given the chance to work in a
darkroom unless they expressly search one out. The Colorado Mountain
College in Breckenridge, CO, to begin construction in 2009, will not
have a darkroom at all ((Leslie Brefeld. "Is digital forcing out
photography’s roots?" Summit Daily News. December 7, 2007. December 17,
2007.

Dave Askeland, interim director, says that the number of students
registering for so-called "wet lab," or traditional darkroom classes, is
"way down" (_ibid._).

So... Is this a bad thing? Maybe yes, maybe no. When I was a boy, I took
a summer class in basic photography. I learned about composition and
simple exposure, but we were young and most of us had our parents'
automatic 35mm cameras, which offered only modest control. By far the
most interesting component of the class was developing the film and
printing in the darkroom.

I enjoyed experimenting with the process and making a few decent prints,
though I can't say that my photography work today was greatly affected
by that experience. For me, the darkroom only enhanced my appreciation
of Photoshop.

Still, traditional photography and its methods has a certain _je ne
sais quoi_, or as Colorado photographer Bob Winsett puts it, "romance."
He goes on to say, "The beauty of the darkroom is that every print that
comes out is slightly unique ... whereas when shooting digital, I think
you destroy some of the romance. You can make two or 5,000 in the exact
same way. Some of the art is lost.” (_ibid._).

He makes a valid point there. Nevertheless, digital photography is a
much more cost-effective solution than traditional methods, which makes
it more attractive to people getting started in the craft. Digital
cameras and computers seem pricey, but compared to high quality
enlargers, the continuous supply of chemicals, film, papers, and the
investment in building your own darkroom or renting time in one, it all
evens out.

I don't believe that film photography and traditional darkroom printing
will ever become obsolete. Just as there are carpenters who pride
themselves on constructing intricate designs without power tools of any
kind, and who create unique masterpieces, so will there be photographers
willing to spend the time and money necessary to make true silver
gelatin prints.

Still, the question remains, will "Generation Z" even know what a
darkroom _is_?
