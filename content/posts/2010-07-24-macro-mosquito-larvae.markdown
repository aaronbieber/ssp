Remember when I [told you
about](/articles/2010/04/21/burrard-lucases-and-the-beetlecam/)
that crazy remote-controlled robot carting a DSLR that these two British
brothers would drive around Africa, taking up-close-and-personal photos
of wild animals? It was called the BeetleCam, and it was the brainchild
of William and Matthew Burrard-Lucas, two swiftly burgeoning wildlife
photographers from the UK.

Well, _they're at it again_, only this time they're not using a
remote-controlled dune buggy and they're not photographing lions or
elephants. They're using an _ingenious_ tabletop lighting setup and
capturing the births of _mosquito larvae_.

See all of the amazing macro photos and read about the brothers'
technical process on their guest post on Digital Photography School!
