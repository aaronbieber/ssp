Right, so I'm following Tom Anderson on Google Plus. You remember Tom?
There is a fairly good chance that if you were on the Internet around
2003 or so, you were friends with Tom. Well, OK, you've probably never
gone to lunch with him, or shaken his hand, or talked to him, or met
him. But you were friends with him on MySpace... Because everyone was.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/l-150x147.png "Tom Anderson")](/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/l.png)

Tom Anderson was the first president of MySpace and the guy who was
automatically added to your friend list the moment you joined. Yeah,
_that Tom_. There he is over there on the right, you remember that
guy? With his judgment-free smile and his own whiteboard to sit in front
of? When you're the president of the first truly successful social
network you can have your _own_ whiteboard. You can put it right next
to your desk if you want to.

Of course, absolutely none of this matters. I should get to the
point.~~MORE~~

Tom Anderson left MySpace in 2009 and now he's just like this sort of
semi-iconic tech nerd floating around posting funny videos on Google
Plus and doing whatever it is successful former dot com presidents do.
Like get recognized by people in restaurants and take photographs.

Oh yes, Tom likes to take photographs, and word has it he's getting
pretty good at it. Anyway, he occasionally posts some photos on his
Google Plus stream and the other day I saw one he took of downtown San
Francisco at night, _through a hotel window_.

If you're anything like me, first of all I'm so sorry, but if you are
anything like me you are probably thinking, "Oh no, photographing
through a window is a terrible idea," and you're right. I mean, it
usually is, because of the reflections on your side of the window. These
ruin photographs.

But of course Tom was with his buddy Trey Ratcliff, the prolific author
and photographer who more or less pioneered HDR photography in the early
'00s and has written best-selling volumes on the subject (I'm suddenly
feeling self-conscious about my own friends and their distinct lack of
notoriety). Anyway, Trey happened to have this neat toy--and this is
where I will finally get to the point of the article, I promise--the
Lenskirt with him.

Such a simple idea, Lenskirt. It suction cups to the window and then
attaches to your lens barrel with a sort of draw string deal. This
creates a pitch black, reflection-free zone all around and (more
importantly) in front of your lens. You almost wish you had come up with
the idea yourself so you could sell these things for _fifty bucks a
pop_. _Plus shipping_.

But, you didn't, and none of your friends are famous, so you should
probably just buy one from the Lenskirt people (there is a link below).
It looks like it's well made, and hey, Trey Ratcliff allegedly owns one,
so that has to count for something, doesn't it?
