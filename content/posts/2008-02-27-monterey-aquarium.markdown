    I love the jellyfish there.  Did you manage to get any decent up-close shots of the moon jellies without using a flash?  Those things continue to confound me because they have no well-defined edges for autofocus to work on and they move just a little too fast for the amount of light in the display to provide for a good shutter/aperture setting.

    I've gotten at least one nice shot of a blue jelly there that's worthy of display (imho):

    Hand-held with an EOS 10D/17-40mm lens, through several inches of curved plexiglas.  I won't tell you how many other shots of the same exhibit got deleted. ;-)

  content: Hi, I really love your beautiful photography, and I looked up something
    about positive/negative for an art quilt Yahoo group where we are studying art
    principles and came to your site, and it was one of the best discussions I have
    found so I provided a link to your site.  I tried to comment on that page, but
    the choice of letter in the alphabet challenge wouldn't work, so I couldn't write
    about it there. I do really appreciate your excellent work and your writing as
    well.  Thank you so much. Peace and many blessings,  Annie

Here are some new quick grabs from Monterey and Big Sur that I wanted to
share.

These are Chris' feet standing on a very small beach as we prepared to
photograph sunset.

During the first two days it was very gloomy and rainy, but the fog
created some awesome scenes.

I also spent a couple of hours at the Monterey Aquarium ([as I mentioned
earlier](/articles/2008/02/26/big-sur-monterey-part-ii/)).
I won't have any "serious" photos ready until after I return and get a
chance to really edit them, but for the time being, here are some quick
edits of some of the things I saw:

This tank has mirrors on both side walls so it looks like the jellies go
on forever.

The aquarium is literally at the seaside and although it was raining,
the view was spectacular.

Another view of the back of the aquarium and the stairway granting water
access.

Here is the somewhat famous kelp forest at the Monterey Aquarium. This
is one of the most photographed and publicized features of the place.
