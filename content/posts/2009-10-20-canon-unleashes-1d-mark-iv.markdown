Well, here it is, folks. As reported by [Digital Photography
Review](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0910/09102001canon1d4.asp), [Rob

[Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/20/canon-eos-1d-mark-iv-announced-16-1-megapixels-45-point-autofo/,)
and undoubtedly more, Canon has officially released the EOS-1D Mark IV,
the latest digital SLR in their 1-series (â€œproâ€?) line.

I find it somewhat amusing that they chose to throw on the EF 50mm f/1.4
for their promo shoot; a lens that, for me, spontaneously stopped
auto-focusing after only a couple years of use and that exhibits pretty
significant vignetting. Nevertheless, the EOS-1D Mark IV is a fairly
intense camera body, with its 10 frame per second burst mode, and ISO
settings up to 102,400. You should be able to lay your hands on one here
in the States for a mere \$4,999.

Personally, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be purchasing a 1D Mark IV, if only
because it has an APS-H sensor with a 1.3x crop factor and I am utterly
spoiled by my 5Dâ€™s full-frame sensor. It is worth noting, also, that
for the \$4,999 that a brand new 1D Mark IV is going to cost you, you
can pretty readily find a pre-owned 1Ds Mark III, which is 21 megapixels
of full-frame goodness.
