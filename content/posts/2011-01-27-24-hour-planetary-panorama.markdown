Oh. My. Good. Gosh. I don't normally head over to Earth Science Picture
of the Day but am I glad I did today! Chris Kotsiopoulos has created
just about the most amazing panorama I have ever seen, though to call it
a "panorama" is almost a disservice to what is really going on within
this image.

![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/24hrsky-590x579.jpg "24-Hour View of the Sky")

This is a compilation of images made throughout an entire day (more than
a day, actually), including the full path of the sun in 15-minute steps
and one magnificent 11-hour star trail opposite the Temple of Poseidon
(Chris lives and photographs in Athens, Greece).

Now, peel your eyes off of this beauty for a second and keep reading.
Not only did Chris sit out in the winter cold for 30 hours to capture
all of these images, he also spent another 12 hours compiling it all
together using a combination of Panotools (PTGui actually) and
Photoshop, and _then_, as though this wasn't enough, he explained it
step-by-step on his forum!

Take one more good look at that fabulous panorama up there and then
[head over to the Greek Sky
forum](http://greeksky.gr/GreekSkyForum/index.php?topic=2).0 and learn
how it was done.

*Edit*: Photojojo [reported on this
image](http://content.photojojo.com/photo-projects/24-hour-panorama/) as
well!
