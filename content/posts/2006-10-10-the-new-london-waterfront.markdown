I picked up and I moved to New London, CT, *The Whaling City*. I can't
say that I'm a huge fan of fishing and whaling, but I am a huge fan of
the waterfront. I finally got a chance to take my camera out and walk
along the pier by the train station last night and I want to share these
with you all.

In front of the police substation, overlooking the main fishing dock.

Various impressive waterfront industrial complexes across the river.

My favorite of the three, my experiments with long exposure facing
another fishing pier.
