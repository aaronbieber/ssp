    Art Concepts in Photography, Part 3: Positive/Negative Space...

    Traditionally, negative space is defined as the “empty” areas within an image. As you will soon see, even that which is empty can be very tangible....

  content: A great series of articles,  just what I was looking for! You're really
    doing a great job explaining stuff that occupies entire sections in libraries
    in so few words. But, as far as I'm concerned, composition needs a far more extended
    explanation, and is a theme for an series of articles itself rather than just
    one.  What I mean is that the article gives a good glance at composition and it's
    principles, but it still is just a glance, and still not enough.  Looking forward
    to read your next "Introduction into Art for the lazy ones " article.

    @Tosha

    There is definitely a lot more to talk about! I've been spending a lot of time making photographs lately and ramping up for a series of [hands-on workshops](/articles/2007/09/14/death-valley-workshop-april-2008/) that I'll be running along with my [friend](http://www.curiouslens.com), but I think I may revisit the composition subject for future in-depth art concepts articles. Thanks for your appreciative comments, I'm glad you're enjoying my articles.

If you haven't, you may want to read the first two parts of the _Art
Concepts_ series, [Part 1:
Texture](/articles/2007/08/02/art-concepts-in-photography-part-1-texture/,)
and [Part 2:
Composition](/articles/2007/08/26/art-concepts-in-photography-part-2-composition/.)

In this, the third bite of our _feast of art knowledge_, I will talk
about an elusive concept called positive and negative space.
Traditionally, negative space is defined as the "empty" areas within an
image. As you will soon see, even that which is empty can be very
tangible.~~MORE~~

Let's start with the most classic demonstration of positive and negative
space at work:

![](/articles/DesignConcepts/PartIII/Figure-4.gif)

Immediately upon viewing this example, you come to realize that your
mind has the capacity to create compositional elements from completely
empty space. As an artist, you must understand this capability so that
you can use it to your advantage. Now let's try something a little bit
different.

![](/articles/DesignConcepts/PartIII/Figure-1.gif)

We generally see black as a "foreground" color and white as a
"background" color, so your first impression of this picture might be
that it's a black jagged thing on a white background. Now take another
look, but this time try to see it as a _white_ jagged thing on a
_black_ background. With some concentration, you should be able to
swap the fields back and forth as you look at it.

Just because a certain space within a composition is "the background"
doesn't mean it is devoid of form.

Now take a look at this funny looking person:

![](/articles/DesignConcepts/PartIII/Figure-2.gif)

The figure on the left and the black field on the right are our positive
space. The white area that surrounds the figure is the negative space,
the "void" in the image. In a photograph, negative space is what you
might casually perceive as the "juicy filling;" it surrounds your
subject(s), it provides them with a place to be, but it is not itself a
subject.

The moral here is simply this: *do not neglect negative space because
it isn't the subject or focal point of your image*. We can easily
manipulate the viewpoint to make the negative space play a more dynamic
role.

![](/articles/DesignConcepts/PartIII/Figure-3.gif)

Here I have moved in closer so that the figure's head touches the top of
the frame, splitting the one large area of negative space into two
smaller ones. This configuration gives the eye a lot more to play with.
I don't mean to say that this version is universally better than the
first one, but it should demonstrate the power that negative space can
wield over even a very simple composition.

Always keep negative space in mind when composing your frame; its shape
is equally as important as that of your subject and your awareness of it
will be immediately visible in your work.
