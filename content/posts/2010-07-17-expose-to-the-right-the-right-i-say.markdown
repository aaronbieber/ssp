    in general. The only caveat I've found is that it's possible to clip one color

    bad color shifts. Your camera may let you see the histograms for individual channels,
    which can warn you about this situation."

    @Brian, you're absolutely right that ETTR and clipping are not the same thing. I wanted to be careful not to give the impression that actually overexposing is a good idea (in terms of losing data, or clipping), though exposing toward the right is.

    With regard to clipping individual colors, I have had good results clipping the red channel in sunset shots in the past, although your mileage may vary. As you say, if your camera offers an RGB histogram view and you are concerned with that possibility, it's a good idea to use it.

    Thanks for your insights!

To the right of your _histogram_ that is. You do
[remember how to read one](/articles/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/),
yes?  Slightly, ever so slightly exposing all of your photographs to the _right_
of the histogram, which is to say _slightly overexposing them_, should be your
goal, 100% of the time.

Why? Because there is more data in the brightest few stops of sensor
attenuation than in the rest of the entire range, which is to say that
there will be more detail, less banding, less noise, and so forth,
within the brightest areas than there will be in the darkest ones. But
you've observed that before, right? You've seen how terrible shadow
areas can look when you try to brighten them up.

> "It's better to overexpose a photo than to underexpose it." ---Will Greenwald

Then there's this guy Will Greenwald. He just posted
[a whole article about this](http://www.tested.com/news/underexposed-vs-overexposed-photos-which-is-worse/558/)
in which he says "it's better to overexpose a photo than to underexpose
it." Awesome, I agree. But neither of us are saying you should "blow
out" any of your image; definitely don't do that.

Strangely, most of the people who commented on Will's article disagreed
with him. _Those people are amateurs_. ~~MORE~~

Why would I say that? I don't even know them, and I am not prone to
hyperbole or dirt-kicking. I'm really not. I'm also sure that all of
those people are well-versed, smart individuals. It's just that... I
guess they don't "get around" much in digital photography circles.

You see, I know something they don't, and I learned it from an article
by Michael Reichmann written some time back around _2003_. I don't
need to tell you who Michael Reichmann is, do I? This information is not
bleeding edge, it's not new news. When Chris Blake and I teach our
[photography workshops](http://artphotoworkshops.com), which I plug on
this blog shamelessly and regularly, one of the first things we talk
about is "exposing to the right," and we've been doing that for three
_years_.

Michael's article is titled, with tongue pressed firmly into cheek,
[Expose Right](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/expose-right/).
He means "to the right of the histogram" as much as he means
"correctly." Read that article if you want all of the technical "nitty
gritty" involved in digital sensor attenuation and so forth.

You'll read about how Michael was chatting with Thomas Knoll. You know,
the guy who _wrote Photoshop_. You'll learn about how they came to
agree upon the fact that _more detail lives in the brightest areas of
an image than in the darkest ones_. That's all you need to know. You
don't need to get any deeper into the technology in order to use this
rule.

Okay, so...

## How do you use this rule?

I'm glad you asked. This is all you need to remember:

**If possible, increase your image's overall exposure until the
histogram almost touches the right edge.**

There are plenty of reasons that you may not be able to do that including
subject motion, lack of light, and so on. Do the best you can. _Tend_ toward the
right of the histogram.

The image shouldn't be _clipped_, which means that if your camera shows little
blinking spots where things are overexposed, _that's still bad_, but get that
graph to move over to the right as far as you can without compromising the
image.

If, like me, you operate in aperture-priority or aperture-value mode (Canon Av,
Nikon A) all you have to do is use your "exposure value," or EV, setting to
increase the exposure of the image as far as you can up until the histogram data
nearly touches the right edge of the graph. If you can't get it all the way over
there without compromising the shot, don't worry about it. This is a rule of
thumb only.

## Then what?

Then you take your photos home and import them into Lightroom and use the
Develop module to adjust the overall brightness of the image using the exposure
slider and curves and anything else you need to until it looks good to
you. That's really it.

Here are some things that you are going to complain about, and why you
shouldn't:

* On your camera's LCD screen, an image exposed to the right may look very
bright, and may look desaturated. It's OK. There is just as much color data in
the image as there was when it was center-exposed, and when you bring it into
Lightroom you can draw that color out, but this time _with more detail than
ever_.

Okay, so that was only one complaint. If you have other complaints,
leave them down there in the comments!

Do you expose to the right already? Do you like it? Do you hate it?
Leave a comment and let us all know!
