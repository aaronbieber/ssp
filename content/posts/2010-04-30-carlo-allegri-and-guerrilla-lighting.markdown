There's this guy... Let's call him "Carlo Allegri." That's his name,
after all. He was born in Bermuda and raised in Toronto, and all he ever
wanted to do was take photographs. He started as a photo-journalist and
worked his way up over many years to finally become a senior
entertainment photographer for Getty in Los Angeles.

The dude loves Profoto gear. Wait, you don't know Profoto? They make
some pretty high-end on-location strobes and other lighting accessories.
([Buy 'em from
B&H](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=profoto&N=0&InitialSearch=yes).)
Two 2400 watt-second strobes with basic reflectors, a battery pack, and
a case to carry them in is going to run you around \$2,500, and then
things go up from there.

Anyway, if you're into off-camera flash, Allegri is someone you should
idolize. He has perfected what he calls "guerrilla lighting" wherein he
can set up a shoot for an A-list celeb, snap off 20 or 30 photos, and
have them off on their way in _sometimes less than five minutes_. This
guy can not only capture the mood and emotion of the individual, but
also throw together a creative lighting setup in as much time as it
would take you to _imagine doing it_.

Speed isn't everything. There is a huge amount of technical savvy and
creativity that goes into a successful photography career, especially
working for Getty and operating at those high-stakes levels. Still, when
it comes to photographing a movie star, pop singer, or even a CEO, you
are going to be in demand among publicists and agents if you can pull it
off in the time it takes your subject to walk from the stage to their
dressing room.
