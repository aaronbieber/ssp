Being an excellent photographer is 50% vision and 50% technical prowess.  Seeing
the art all around you is only useful for the photographer who can capture it,
and perfectly executing that capture means wrangling the piece of hardware you
love so much, the camera.

These days, most photographers are shooting digital. Digital photography is
freeing in a lot of ways, but it is also more complicated. Camera manufacturers
have sought to close the gap between the pro and the semi-pro by providing all
of these different shooting modes, and even though I still believe you only need
three, it's not unusual to see mode dials with 11 or 12 settings on them! _You
don't need all those settings to get full control!_ Haje Jan Kamps helps me
explain after the break.<!--more-->

I've written about this before
in [Be a Control Freak (Shooting Modes Explained)][bacf], but the subject came
up again today when I saw Haje Jan Kamps' really cool
article, [Translating the mode wheel][mode] on pixiq. My article explains in
some amount of gory detail what each mode does, Haje takes it a step further
with example images and a plea to leave those silly program modes behind.

Haje says:

> This little dial is called your mode wheel, and itâ€™s your mortal enemy, the
> destroyer of creativity, and the root of all evil in the world including, but
> not limited to, wars, swine flu, and stepping in chewing gum with a new pair
> of shoes.

Definitely hop over to pixiq and [read Haje's article][mode], check
out [my previous article][bacf] if you haven't read it before, and if you are
hankering for even more information...

## Learn Tips and Tricks for Real-Life Shooting

![](/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/kelbybooks.jpg "The Digital Photography Book(s)")

These three books are among the most straightforward guides to the real-life
application of camera settings in a broad variety of situations that I've come
across. They're written by Scott Kelby, the publisher and editor of Photoshop
User and Layers magazines, president and co-founder of the National Association
of Photoshop Professionals, and founder of the eponymous training website
(kelbytraining.com).

He's written over 40 books. I haven't read them all, but I've read these, and
they're awesome. They're short, not too expensive, presented in plain language,
and useful to photographers at nearly any skill level. The three books don't
progress in skill level or detail, they are simply three chapters of the same
overall plot, so you can snag the one with the prettiest cover, flip a coin, or
just buy all three.

Here are the three individual books, they're each about 25 bucks or less, I
think the second volume is the cheapest:

* [The Digital Photography Book, Vol.  1](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/461804-REG/Pearson_Education_9780321474049_Book_The_Digital_Photography.html/BI/1816/KBID/2457)
* [The Digital Photography Book, Vol.  2](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/526705-REG/Pearson_Education_9780321524768_Book_The_Digital_Photography.html/BI/1816/KBID/2457)
* [The Digital Photography Book, Vol.  3](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/629825-REG/Pearson_Education_0321617657_Book_The_Digital_Photography.html/BI/1816/KBID/2457)

Or get them all together in this B&H kit. I think you save about $1.50, so I
guess the kit is offered for convenience, but hey, convenience has gotta be
worth something, right?

* [The Digital Photography Book, Vols. 1-3 B&H Kit](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/568736-REG/Pearson_Education_978_0_321_67873_7_Book_The_Digital_Photography.html/BI/1816/KBID/2457)

They're really swell books, and I don't usually jump on the bandwagon when it
comes to these sort of corporate "training mill" publishers but Scott knows what
he's talking about and presents it in a very clear way so I'd be doing you all a
disservice not to recommend them to you.

Moreover, if you click through these links here, you get the same books for the
same prices you would pay if you went straight to B&H's website yourself, but I
also get a tiny little commission that helps me keep this site online, so if you
are even remotely thinking about picking up a book or two, please use these
links and help me out.
