The title of this post is a quote from the film "Sneakers;" one of my
favorite movies of all time (I'm a huge nerd). I am actually in
Monterey, though. Monterey, California to be precise.

We've only been out photographing a couple of times so far. The weather
here is inclement and probably won't clear up until later this
afternoon. We're going to head over to the Monterey Aquarium to see what
we can see there since it's really rainy and gloomy outside, then
hopefully catch sunset out in Big Sur just as the storm passes us by.

Feel free to click the photo on the right [or follow this link right

to check out my ever-growing Flickr stream of snapshots from this
journey.
