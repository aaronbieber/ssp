Someone might be publishing one of your photographs right now. Without your
permission.

Photographers today are faced with the very real possibility that their rights
are being violated due to the simplicity that digital media brings to the act of
duplication and distribution of their work. Your ability as a photographer to
understand and apply the tools and techniques available to protect your
copyrights will contribute largely to how easily someone else can wrongly profit
from your work and how easily you can seek remedies for that
infringement.~~MORE~~

This is a long article. I get into some detail about copyright law, the
implications of at least two types of self-attribution you can use to assert
your copyrights, the technical aspects of metadata and some of its history, and
more. But because I am considerate and I want the impatient and lazy among you
to be equally satisfied to have dropped by (thank you, by the way), here are the
major points:

* The Orphan Works Act of 2006 does not threaten to dilute your rights as a
  copyright holder. Which is to say, it wouldn't even if it actually _passed_,
  which it hasn't.

* There are two major forms of metadata, one older one and one newer one, and
  you should learn how to use them properly.

* Watermarks are _so_ ugly.

Now, if you feel up to it, dive in.

An article ran in this month's issue of Shutterbug magazine called "How to
Protect Your Images: Photos on the Web Might Be Fair Game." The article was
written by Jon Canfield and centered around one specific concern raised by a
little piece of legislation called H.R. 5439 or, in plain English, the "Orphan
Works Act of 2006," which has not yet been passed.

Setting aside for a moment the somewhat alarmist phrasing of the article's
title, which seems to imply that the government could declare open season on
copyrighted works on the Internet, and ignoring the calculated impression a
reader might get from the first two paragraphs that the Orphan Works Act will do
just that, Canfield offers several good tips.

## Orphan Works Act of 2006

Before delving full-throttle into the nitty gritty of copyright law and what you
can do to protect yourself, I must first dispell concerns about the Orphan Works
Act of 2006. If you want
to [read it](http://www.publicknowledge.org/pdf/ow-act-2006.pdf), there it is,
in all of its PDF glory. So what is an "orphan work," anyway? An orphan work is
one whose copyright holder and rightful owner cannot be reasonably
discovered. The Act attempts to fill the void in current copyright law where
orphan works live. Canfield says:

> Boiled down to plain English, this act says that if a reasonable effort is
> made to find the owner of an image, and that search is unsuccessful, the work
> can be used at no charge and without credit to the original creator.

There is mounting concern---legitimate concern---among the agencies of various
governments equivalent to our Copyright Office regarding the fate of these
creative works whose owners may not be outwardly apparent or may have
disappeared and left no next of kin, etc., etc. It's all very legal and
complicated, but suffice it to say, if you want to use a painting that you found
somewhere and nobody could identify its creator, so you searched up and down for
them but found nothing, you might use that painting only to have the creator
suddenly reveal him or herself and sue you. And they could win.

The Orphan Works Act of 2006 seeks to "limit remedies" sought by the creator of
a work when their ownership status could not "reasonably" be discovered. That
doesn't mean, by any _stretch_ of the imagination, that people could start using
your photographs and somehow slip through a loophole in copyright law that would
absolve them of guilt. First and foremost, the Orphan Works Act of 2006 hasn't
even been passed, so none of its provisions have any legal weight
whatsoever. Second, even if it had been passed, it doesn't give additional
rights to copyright infringers. In point of fact, it places the burden of proof
on the infringer to document their search for the proper owner of the copyright
in question and to further prove that they performed the search with "reasonable
diligence," making use of "reasonably available expert assistance" and
"reasonably available technology."

_Furthermore_, the Act also holds that if the infringer had discovered, to any
degree, the identity of the owner of the work, that they must have provided
attribution "in a manner reasonable under the circumstances." In other words, if
someone meant to use one of your photographs but couldn't figure out exactly who
you were, they would, under the Orphan Works Act, be required to give you credit
to the extent they were able. If they only knew your first name, for instance,
they would have to use it in an attribution or fail to meet the criteria of the
Act's provisions.

What that means to you as a photographer is that you should be certain of
anyone's ability to locate you as the creator and owner of your work with a
_reasonable_ level of diligence. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to plaster
your name and website URL across the middle of your images (although it could
help; I'll get into that later), but it does mean you have to make yourself
available to be contacted and to do what you think is reasonably expected of you
to claim ownership of your work.  So what does that mean?

Let us assume that the Orphan Works Act will be signed into law. I hope that I
have allayed any fears that this Act could dissolve your rights as creators
outright, but as they say, you can never be too careful. The Act clearly
describes the level of diligence that is expected of an infringer in their
search for the owner of a work, and one of the specific tools mentioned is
"reasonably available technology," which is what I assume Canfield latched onto
when he dove into the topic of _metadata_.

## Using Metadata

Metadata refers to one of two major types of non-image data that can be embedded
into certain image files. The first type is IPTC, which stands for International
Press Telecommunications Council. At least as far back as the early '90s it has
been possible to use Photoshop or a similar tool to embed non-image data into
the "header" of a Photoshop, JPEG, or TIFF image using the method IPTC came up
with. Eventually, though, Adobe came along and decided there needed to be more
data. Around 2001, Adobe launched XMP, or Extensible Metadata Platform, which
they hoped would provide even more useful metadata space within popular image
formats.  XMP also defines "synchronization" methods to move certain data fields
back and forth between itself and IPTC; Photoshop naturally supports this.

Right now we're in a transitional period between IPTC and XMP formats.  Adobe
envisions XMP basically absorbing IPTC, and although that has already begun to
happen with the strength of Photoshop and Lightroom as the premiere metadata
management tools in use, it's probably a good idea to fill in every field you
can regardless of which standard it's defined in. In most applications that
support metadata tagging, there is now a section called "IPTC Core" and then
another for XMP. It won't hurt you to pay attention to both.

I should note that Aperture also supports XMP metadata, but I am a Lightroom
user so I won't be able to talk about Aperture's interface or specific
support. If you use Aperture and have anything to share about metadata, please
leave a comment.

## Watermarks

The most popular way to assert copyright on an image is to emblazon it with your
name and/or URL and/or a phrase such as "All Rights Reserved." Personally, I
find most "watermarks" to be distracting, distasteful, and poorly executed. To
me, a watermark screams opportunism, perhaps a small drop of greed, and utter
distrust. The level of greed and distrust that I perceive is directly
proportional to the size and audacity of the watermark. Watermarks with outer
glows, very thick lettering, or worst of all _colors_ drive me up the
wall. Musn't there be a way to indicate ownership without stabbing your viewers
in the eye with Photoshop filters and text set in Papyrus?

To me, the watermark has two distinct purposes:

* To deter would-be thieves from snatching up your image and using it for their
  own nefarious purposes.

* To increase awareness of (read: advertise) you and/or your website to the
  people who would be most interested in it: people who look at photographs.

Having a watermark probably doesn't deter the small-time offender, but I don't
think it's important. Someone who wants to spend the time to Photoshop out the
watermark and make a very poor inkjet print of your photo because they wanted to
hang it above their toilet is not the person who was going to bring you fame or
fortune in the first place.  Photographs prepared at web-viewable resolutions
are virtually worthless outside of the Internet, anyway; prints from images of
that size are not going to look very good, so the risk of being defrauded is
marginal.

The copyright symbol itself and the "All Rights Reserved" phrase are so
ubiquitous these days that most folks don't even think twice before copying
things and using them in all sorts of bizarre personal efforts.  I say go for
it; I'm a big supporter of derivative work and if you want to wallpaper your
house with web resolution copies of my photographs, well, frankly I'd be
honored.

The bottom line is that watermarks aren't tremendously effective deterrents. The
only way a watermark is going to truly deter a would-be offender is if it covers
the image in some distracting way. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of showing
off your work in the first place? It may also be said that a visible watermark
strengthens your legal copyright claim. It may make such a claim more
_convenient_ certainly, but in the eyes of the law, metadata is just as
strong. Even stronger would be possessing the full-resolution version of the
photograph. You have that at least, right?

As you can see on this blog and in my gallery, I chose to apply a very modest
watermark to my work. My intent was to make it very easy for a casual onlooker
who discovers a photo of mine outside of this site to be able to identify me,
but also to disturb the original image and its impact as little as
possible. Coupled with metadata, I feel that this solves the problem of
asserting my legal rights to my work as well as giving me a bit of casual
advertising.

I am always ready and willing to answer questions and discuss particular topics
in greater detail. If you want to share your own experiences with copyright,
watermarking, or metadata, please leave a comment. You are not required to sign
