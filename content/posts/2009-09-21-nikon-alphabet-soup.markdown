For those of you Nikon shooters out there who ritualistically browse the
B&H catalog and wonder What on Earth is a f/4.5-5.6G ED-IF AF-S VR DX
lens, anyway?, now there is an answer for you, straight from our
favorite bringer-of-technological-clarity, Bob Johnson at Earthbound
Light.

In his post [Nikon Lens Designation Alphabet
Soup](http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/nikon-lens-letter-codes.html),
Bob explains the meaning of all of those little acronyms that Nikon
seems to throw around like confetti. At last, an understandable answer!
