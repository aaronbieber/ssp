I got sick over my Thanksgiving break, which is a great reminder that
even national holidays are not recognized by most viruses. In fact—and I
have this on good authority—most viruses don't even speak English.

It's been hard for me to come up with any new work, as I've been putting
a lot of time into the
[boxdoodles](http://www.thebailiwick.com/boxdoodles/) initiative. I hope
everyone here can get something out of that.

Here are a couple of shots from Thanksgiving.

That is a fake Christmas tree. Inauthentic. Faux. Imitation. Artificial.
Simulated. Still pretty.
