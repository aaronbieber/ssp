It has been about a month since my last post, but it feels like an
_eternity_. There is so much going on right now and I have a lot of
pots on the stove, so this will be the first of a few update posts to
bring you all up to speed.

*Canada is beautiful*. I was able to spend a few days in _Algonquin
Provincial Park_, the first park established in Canada and a sizable
(7,000+ square kilometers, which is 1.7 _million_ acres) wildlife
sanctuary. The early spring is the best time to get up there because the
moose come out of the woods and let me tell you, they are everywhere. My
trip happened to coincide with Michael Reichmann's [Moose Workshop
2008](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/workshops/ws-moose-08.shtml), but
I swear it was a coincidence.

I'll have photos of that excursion posted soon.

*Chicago is also beautiful*, though perhaps in a different way. My
[Chicago Loop
Workshop](http://www.artphotoworkshops.com/2008/June/ChicagoLoop) is
coming up next month, it's just a three-day affair, very informal, and
should be a lot of fun. At this very moment, I still have *three seats
open*, so now is a good time to
[register](http://www.artphotoworkshops.com/2008/June/ChicagoLoop) if you
want to join us! The cost is just \$449.

I'll be running this workshop along with Chris Blake from [The Curious
Lens](http://www.curiouslens.com), though his website is undergoing a
complete overhaul right now so there isn't too much to see. We are going
to visit all of the main architectural attractions in Chicago as well as
Navy Pier, the "bean" and Millennium Park, and so forth. There will also
be time for critique and review, maybe even some Lightroom/Photoshop
tutorials if anyone is interested.

*Santa Cruz is even _more_ beautiful*, especially in the summer! In
July, Chris and I will be at [Calypso Imaging](http://calypsoinc.com/) in
gorgeous downtown Santa Cruz, a city of artists and free-thinkers
directly on the coast of central California, teaching a three-day
*digital workflow course*, focusing on organizing and processing
images using *Lightroom* and *Photoshop CS3*. If you keep taking
more and more photos every day and want to tighten up your cataloging
and processing, [register and join
us](http://www.artphotoworkshops.com/2008/July/CalypsoWorkflowClass!)
This course is only \$400.

I'll also be doing a workshop with the inimitable [Dan
Heller](http://www.danheller.com) in October in gorgeous *Woodstock,
Vermont*, right about the time when the fall foliage should be
strongest. [Read about the workshop and
register](http://www.danheller.com/cgi/orderform).pl on Dan's site. This
workshop is all-inclusive, which means you only need to make your way to
Woodstock somehow and the rest is taken care of. Dan, Chris, and myself
will all be giving instruction, so there should be no difficulty in
getting your questions answered.
