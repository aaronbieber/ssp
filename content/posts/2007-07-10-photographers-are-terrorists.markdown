{{< random "right" >}}

I hope you read the subject of this article and gasped. I hope that your first
reaction was indignance or perhaps anger. I share your feelings, but we
photographers continuously deal with a level of public distrust and scrutiny
that should worry us all. It's important, whether you're an amateur or a
professional, to know what your rights are and to stand up for them so they
don't erode into nothingness, leaving us all standing there with our cameras and
nothing to point them at.

Today I'm going to talk about photographers' rights, a topic discussed in many
other forums and at great length. My focus will be on United States laws: what
you are legally permitted to photograph; what, if any, argument you should be
willing to put up with from certain officials; and some of my own experiences.

Please come in, photography is allowed.<!--more-->

## What Are Your Rights?

{{< random "left" >}}

The first thing I'm going to do is point you in the direction of Andrew Kantor's
wonderful [Legal Rights of Photographers][lrp] guide (pdf, linked with
permission). Andrew breaks our work down into its major (legal) components and
explains what rights we have to photograph, to publish the work, to withstand
accusations, etc., all with clear examples. It's really the best overview of
photographers' rights I've seen yet.

One of the biggest legal revelations I took away from Andrew's guide is that it
is OK to photograph while trespassing, even if the trespass itself is
illegal. Many of us have trespassed here and there to get certain shots, and
although I am not going to come out and publicly _condone_ it, it's reassuring
to know that the work stands on its own and won't come back to bite me.

## Problems I've Had

When I first became serious about art photography (which is what I'd say I do),
my friend [Chris Blake](http://www.curiouslens.com) and I would travel to
various public state parks and reservoirs and shoot for entire afternoons. It's
good exercise and being outside is always pleasant in the summer months, so we
did it a lot. I wouldn't say I came away with many timeless masterpieces, but it
was excellent practice. Once, while we were photographing some type of a
drainage pipe at Reservoir #6 (its name stands in triumphant evidence of the
municipal government's creativity) in West Hartford on a beautiful spring
afternoon, a pickup truck came rumbling up toward us, stopped, a man got out,
walked over to where we were standing, and informed us that "they" didn't like
people photographing around the water source. He mentioned something about
"terrorists;" I don't completely recall. He didn't make any overt threats and he
seemed personally disinterested, but he said he was asked to tell us this and
that we should really stop if we didn't want to make trouble for ourselves.

Having read Andrew Kantor's Legal Rights of Photographers, I understand now that
it is legal to take photographs within the reservoir grounds because they are
open to the public and that it's legal to publish them as well. Even when asked
to leave (which we weren't), at which time you are officially trespassing, you
can still take photographs and use them however you like.

Another, more serious incident occurred along Route 10 near Bradley
International Airport. Chris and I went out for a photographic adventure and
wound up in a *public* parking lot at the head of an arrival runway at dusk. The
plan: to photograph planes landing over the chain link fence. Photographing
aircraft, even from a public vantage point, is one of those "gray areas" in
photography; even though it's legal, you're probably asking for trouble. (The
image to the right was made that night.)

I believe (though I am not a laywer) there are clauses that prohibit the
photography of things like submarines, military helicopters, etc., even in
public. It's one of those "national security" issues; the same reason why dry
docked submarines always have their propellers covered (the design of the
propellers is top secret, even to most submarine engineers and crew
members). Privately owned and operated aircraft, however, fall into no such
category and there are no laws that expressly prohibit photographing
them. Still, you're going to get hassled. And we were.

To the credit of our local law enforcement agencies, it was only a matter of
perhaps fifteen minutes before a state police trooper rolled into the parking
lot and asked us what we thought we were doing. We explained that we both have
photography websites and that we were taking some artsy photos, etc., etc. Signs
posted around the parking lot clearly denote that it is public and not the
property of the airport, so we weren't trespassing. He said he was certain we
meant no harm but that we would have to stop.

We did stop, by the way, because neither of us wanted to spend the rest of the
night in the local police station explaining ourselves and missing out on other
opportunities. Perhaps today our reactions might differ. The image to the left
was also made that night.

Some people are more persistent in the face of authority figures, and that's
probably a good thing if they're asserting their rights. Still, you must always
weigh the benefits of defending your rights against the perils of doing so.

## Conclusions

At the end of the day, you are the risk-taker. It's up to you whether you want
to press your luck within the law or stray from strict legality to achieve your
creative ends. Whatever the case may be, the most important tool at your
disposal is full knowledge of your rights.

As I've mentioned in previous articles, some of my most popular and most
searched photographs are from within the Knight building of the Mansfield
Training School, a location I was most certainly trespassing upon when I made
them. I think it was worth the risk.
