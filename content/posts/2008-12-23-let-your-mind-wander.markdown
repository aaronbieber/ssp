On the path to creativity, it's not only _okay_ to stop and smell the
roses, it's _encouraged_.

My approach to inspiration is not to chase it; I tend to walk around in
a place or idly browse others' works until the desire to create
something strikes. Still, it's nice to have a "toolbox" of tricks to get
you past those creative lulls in life. According to psychologist
Jonathan Schooler (no, really, that's his actual name), daydreaming is
one possible answer.

Well, if you know you're doing it, that is.

From Boston.com (Jonah Lehrer):

> "If your mind didn't wander, then you'd be largely shackled to

> instead you can engage in mental time travel and other kinds of

And who wouldn't want to _time travel_? The key, though, is
self-awareness of your wandering mind. The study concluded that people
who were able to recognize when they were daydreaming demonstrated more
of a predilection to creativity than those who were only able to
identify their daydreams _after_ they happened.

When I read this story I began thinking about my own daydreaming habits.
I think I can say with certainty that I absolutely know when I'm
daydreaming... Because I love it. There's nothing like taking a little
break from reality now and then!

Despite photography's firm basis in reality—capturing real light
reflecting off of real objects—it is in so many ways an _escape_ from
reality, and an art form that can benefit from your daydreams just as
much as any other.

So the next time you find yourself staring off into the distance and
traveling mentally through time and space, don't pull yourself back down
to Earth so quickly.
