After spending a few days in Yosemite National Park (photographing from
before dawn until after dark each day), we came out to Santa Cruz to
spend some time on the California coast. I have never been here before,
but to say that I love it would be an understatement.

In search of recreational as well as photographic opportunities, I
decided to spend a couple of hours walking around the University of
California Santa Cruz's arboretum, which is open every day from nine to
five and is completely free (always a plus). I took a lot of photos
there, but here are a few of my favorite "textural" ones. These aren't
intended to be strict foreground/background, subject/backdrop photos,
but rather as tangible shapes and textures.

I will be posting a *lot* more Santa Cruz and Yosemite photos in the
coming week, so don't forget about me!
