After suffering from a complete server meltdown in my self-hosted environment,
where my gallery website once lived, I started to think pretty seriously about
hosting my photographs somewhere else. I wanted to know that all of my images
were being backed up, that I wouldn't lose precious metadata, and as long as
someone else was writing the software, I wanted a more robust e-commerce system.

I decided to research photo hosting services. Because my co-instructor and
friend [Chris](http://curiouslens.com) had been using Photoshelter for some time
and had nothing but good things to say about it, it started at the top of my
list.

This is a story about my experiences with Photoshelter and why you should
probably stop reading right now and sign up. ~~MORE~~

## A Brief Preface

It's worth mentioning that during the daytime, when I'm not fighting crime
and [teaching photography workshops](http://artphotoworkshops.com,) I'm a web
application developer. I've been building websites professionally for more than
ten years now, and I certainly know a good web app when I see one.

My previous gallery was based on the
ubiquitous [Gallery 2](http://gallery.menalto.com/) script with _very_ heavy
customizations. I think their architecture and codebase is a solid one.  You can
purchase hosted galleries from them, and although I have no experience with
their hosted service, it's probably worth it. They have a very smart developer
community.

Nevertheless, what I was looking for here was something more _serious_, a little
bit less _hobbyist_. It turned out that Photoshelter, in spite of its few
weaknesses, fit the bill.

## Photoshelter's Weaknesses

![](/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Thumbs-down.jpg "Thumbs down")

As a developer and as a perfectionist, I have my qualms about
Photoshelter. Before I enumerate what I think are Photoshelter's weakest points,
let me say that I gave a very serious look at what seems to be their major
competitor, [Zenfolio](http://zenfolio.com), and decided that Photoshelter is
miles better for my needs.

Still, Photoshelter has its issues:

* When you upload photos, they go into the "archive," which is basically a
  storage area for your images. From there, they can be copied into galleries,
  sold to customers, etc.

  * Though the archive allows you to create nested folder structures, drag and
    drop items, and generally acts like a Windows or OS X interface, it's only
    for your use. Which brings me to the real issue here, and that is...

  * Galleries can't be nested. You can create "collections" of galleries, but
    that's it. Collections also can't be nested. On top of all of that,

  * The gallery organization screen is totally different from the
    archive. "Action" links are moved to a different spot, the way you move items
    and operate on them is different. It's a UI oversight and a nightmare for your
    learning curve.

* There is no real templating.

  * Though you can choose among a few pre-created themes, which are OK, the
    ability to create a custom "theme" is limited to pasting in the top portion
    and bottom portion of the layout. You can never change the location or
    wording of any of the contents of the site, other than through stylesheets.

  * This is more of a minor gripe from a guy who more or less wrote his site
    from scratch, but it's still something I would like to see more support for.

## Photoshelter's Strengths

All that aside, Photoshelter is responsive to customer requests. I have
submitted my qualms about these things to the company, and they have
told me that collections within collections is currently under
development. So hopefully I'll be able to remove that from this post in
the near future.

The other things that Photoshelter seems to be really good at are:

* *Adding new features*: They have added support for TinEye and PicScout
  recently, among other things. Each month brings some enhancements, which are
  reported in their newsletter.

* *SEO (Search Engine Optimization)*: As much as I believe SEO to be a mythical
  black box that only the anointed can see within, Photoshelter has configured
  their themes and designs to accommodate best practices, and that counts for a
  lot.

* *E-commerce*: There are several options available to those who
  wish to sell their images, such as:

  * Licensing (using an externally maintained and constantly updated pricing
    model based on circulation and business use, e.g. "for royalty-free use in a
    magazine in the northeast of the U.S. with a circulation of 100,000.")

  * Sell electronic copies in a few fixed dimensions to individuals for personal
    use,

  * Sell actual prints, either fulfilled by Mpix, or self-fulfilled (by you).

With the e-commerce options you can just use PayPal, which is easy and
free (free to set up an account, but they do take a percentage of each
transaction as their fee), or you can use a merchant account if you have
one. Those can be costly to maintain, but is a better way for a higher
volume licensing business to broaden its margins.

## Why Use Photoshelter?

Okay, so why should you want to pay a company 30 or more dollars per
month to host your image gallery and go through the process of
re-uploading all of your images to a new location, organizing them, and
so forth?

* What do you gain by it?

* Is it worth the trouble of re-uploading everything?

* How many numbered lists can one blog post have?

Well, at least I can tell you what I have gained by it:

* Peace of mind that full-resolution, developed versions of my images are hosted
  and backed up by a reputable third party (meaning that my sales can continue
  regardless of the state of my own computer, my own website, and so on),

* The ability to expand my copyright enforcement (with PicScout), to reach a
  larger community of eyes (through Photoshelter's publicly searchable site),
  and to expand my photography business as Photoshelter expands its features,

* The knowledge that people are working 40-hour weeks to keep my photos online,
  and to make them more searchable and easier to buy, and

* More things to write lists of.

What more could you ask for?
