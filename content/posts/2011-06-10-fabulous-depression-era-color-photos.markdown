The goal of photography is to capture a moment, an idea, a thought, or
an event and suspend it in time. Whether it is journalistic, editorial,
representational, abstract, or artistic is not important in reaching
that goal. Occasionally, as a photographer is striving toward their
singular goal, they unwittingly meet another one.

Such is the case with these amazing depression-era color photographs
published by the International Business Times; though they were taken at
the time as recordings of events (though demonstrating the aesthetic
sense of the accomplished photographer), the social and cultural
distance between the depression and today has vaulted these images into
pure artistry. They are truly breathtaking; scenes from a past world, a
past America.
