Here we are at the beginning of September already, and I haven't even
posted these photos from July! These were taken at Mill Pond Park in
Newington, CT during their "Mill Pond Park Extravaganza," which happened
to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Newington's Parks and Rec.
Department. There were fireworks, there was fried dough, there were
heaps of people... Some of them were waving glowing toys around.
