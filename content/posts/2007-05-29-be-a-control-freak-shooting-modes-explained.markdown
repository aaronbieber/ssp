  content: "I read your last post, you did a fine job but I have an issue to take
    up with you:\n\n\"I have personally found that approach to be too tedious, especially
    when the shutter speed itself has no bearing whatsoever on the way the image will
    come out.\"\n\nShutter speed has everything to do with how the image will come
    out. If your shutter speed is to slow the image might not be sharp, its its a
    tad to long it might be over exposed.\n\nThink about this for an example, I'm
    shutting a deer in low light, the deer is going to move so I know I have to have
    a fast shutter speed. I set my lens to f2.8 and then set my shutter speed to be
    fast enough that I can get the deer in the photo with out any blur. If I used
    Av and set my camera to 2.8 it would have likely chosen a slower shutter speed.
    My images of the deer from Yosemite where all a little dark (underexposed if you
    asked the camera) but no matter in my RAW work\nflow I was able to fix that in
    2 sec.\n\nSure I could use Av mode, set my lens at f2.8 and then change the EV
    mode to tick my camera into using a faster shutter speed. But that takes as much
    if not more effort then setting the shutter speed by hand. \n\nI'm not saving
    Av is never good, I've played with it a lot. In fact I use Av or auto when I am
    doing 'street photography'. I know its not perfect but I'd rather get the shot
    then miss it playing around with my setting."

    Perhaps I should be a little more clear in my phrasing, but I wasn't intending to say that shutter speed *never* has an effect, which obviously it does. Rather, I was saying that in the cases where shutter speed plays no major role (and that, for me, is 90% of the time), why bother having to set it manually? It's just one more dial to turn to get to zero EV.

    I would say that 90% of the time you want a photograph that is exposed to middle gray, which is what metering will do for you, and evaluative metering really works 90% of the time.

    Even when the shutter speed *is* important, I personally leave my camera in Av mode and use the EV controls to "force" the shutter speed to where I want it (which I believe I mentioned in the post). In exactly the same way you would set the shutter speed and notice that the camera blinks "-1 EV" in the viewfinder, I would simply set it explicitly to -1 EV and get exactly the same effect.

    It's really six of one and a half dozen of the other; everyone has their own preferred method. I'm sorry if I misrepresented your approach, but it seemed a good example of a different opinion of shooting modes.

    Use Your Digital SLR's Shooting Modes...

    Most (if not all) digital SLR cameras have a variety of “modes” that they can be operated in, such as Av, Tv, Portrait, and so on. I will attempt to demystify these modes and explain how to use them most effectively for the greatest creative impact...

    Good article. Really.

    I'm using Nikon, and always use Av - aperture priority. ;-)
    But if I shot sport, I use - Tv, or P mode.

  content: Thanks Vladislav! Shooting sports is a good example of a time when shutter
    speed is more important than aperture and using S or Tv mode is probably more
    appropriate. Thanks for commenting.

Most (if not all) digital SLR cameras have a variety of "modes" that
they can be operated in, such as _Av_, _Tv_, _Portrait_, and so
on. To the novice it may seem as though some of the modes are redundant,
and certainly to some degree that is true, but they all have their uses.
Today I will attempt to demystify these modes and explain how to use
them most effectively for the greatest creative impact.~~MORE~~

First off, here is my general-purpose disclaimer: I have always been a
Canon user, so my statements and opinions regarding other camera models
are based solely on research and not on experience. That said, the
fundamental concepts of photography are exactly the same no matter what
type of camera you are using, so aside from mixing up some terminology
here and there, this should be a usable guide.

Before I dive into each of the specific modes available on various
cameras, let's briefly review the two main camera settings and their
effects on creative output:

* *Shutter speed*: The amount of time for which your shutter remains
open, typically measured in seconds or fractions of a second. Faster
shutter speeds can more effectively "freeze" moving objects. Even if the
objects in your scene are standing still, a faster shutter speed can
"freeze" the shake of your camera that occurs from holding it in your
hands.

* *Aperture*: The aperture is one of the hardest concepts for novices
to pick up because its system of measurement is seemingly arbitrary and
because the numbers on the scale get larger when they intuitively ought
to get smaller. The aperture setting refers to the size of an opening
through which light is allowed to pass, and has an effect on "depth of
field," which, simply stated, is how blurry (or sharp) _stuff_ is. A
wider aperture admits more light and permits the out-of-focus areas of
the image to be *more* out-of-focus, while the opposite is true of a
narrower aperture.

Manipulating these two settings will greatly affect the outcome of your
photographs and allow you to create the compositions and effects that
you're after. For the most part, shooting modes do nothing more than
manipulate these two important settings. Knowing what these modes do
will allow you to create the same effects using only manual controls.

Here are some of the shooting modes available with the major
camera-makers' cameras (Nikon calls these "Digital Vari-Programs" and
Canon calls them "PictureStyles"):

* Portrait
 * Landscape
 * Close-up
 * Sports
 * Night landscape
 * Night portrait
 * Sunset

In addition, virtually every SLR camera has these four basic settings
available on their mode dials (I have noted the names in Canon and Nikon
lingo, respectively):

* Av (aperture value), or A (aperture priority auto)
 * Tv (time value), or S (shutter priority auto)
 * P (program or programmed auto)
 * M, which pretty much always stands for _manual_

## Content-Related Modes

The first set of modes I listed (Digital Vari-Programs or PictureStyles)
can change a host of parameters related to how the image is captured and
finally saved. Nikon's set of Digital Vari-Programs essentally
manipulate shutter speed, aperture, and basic settings such as whether
the flash will fire and what type of auto-focus to use. In "Portrait"
mode for example, a larger aperture is selected, which causes the
background to become blurrier and softer; opening the aperture also
requires a faster shutter speed. "Night portrait" causes a slower
shutter speed to be selected but also fires the flash (the flash lights
your subject while leaving the shutter open for a bit longer allows the
background to come into view; this technique is sometimes called
"dragging the shutter.")

"Sports" mode instructs the auto-focus to keep the center of the frame
focused at all times (in the Canon world we would be using the AI Focus
or the more sophisticated AI Servo settings). For the most part, at
least in the Nikon realm, these Digital Vari-Programs don't do anything
you couldn't do yourself in Manual mode with a bit of practice.

In the Canon realm, the PictureStyles modes do almost the same things,
but they have also thrown some other changes into the mix. Using their
Digic image processing system, Canon's PictureStyles modes also subtly
change the color reproduction of the images. In "Portrait" mode, skin
tones are given preferential treatment, while "Landscape" mode increases
the saturation of greens and blues and so on. These changes are only
applied to JPEG images; RAW images will not be changed.

These different shooting modes can be helpful for the amateur to achieve
the desired outcome without a great deal of knowledge or experience in
the post-processing area. Canon's PictureStyles settings in particular
were designed to yield totally usable JPEG images directly from the
camera without a need for post-processing, and I think that in most
cases they do work. Nikon's Digital Vari-Programs are helpful in getting
the camera to tweak its own automatic selection of the main camera
settings for different situations without altering the image file itself
in any overt way.

## Be a Control Freak

All of these PictureStyles and Digital Vari-Programs are great and
everything, but they won't help you to be a more versatile photographer.
Learning about photography takes a lot more than switching a dial to
"Portrait," pointing it at someone, and pressing the button. For
example, you may want to change the intensity of the effects that the
PictureStyles offer, not to mention that once you start shooting in RAW
you won't get much out of them, anyway.

My personal preference is to use _Av_ (on the Nikon it's called A)
mode nearly all the time. What this allows me to do is select the
aperture I want and let the camera meter the scene and select a shutter
speed appropriately. On top of that, there is one more level of control
called the _EV_ or Exposure Value. This allows me to say to the
camera, _under-expose this shot by 1/3 of a stop_, or _over-expose
this shot by 1 full stop_.

The benefit of shooting in _Av_ mode for my style of work is that I
can dictate what the depth of field will be like (how blurry or sharp
stuff will be) within the limitations of available light and so on. I
have found it to be an equally intuitive and versatile method.

My friend from [The Curious Lens](http://www.curiouslens.com) uses _M_,
or Manual mode, all the time. His method involves metering the scene
and, based on the camera's assessment of whether it's over- or
under-exposed, adjusting the shutter speed, the aperture, or both until
the exposure reads at the level he wants it. I have personally found
that approach to be too tedious, especially when the shutter speed
itself has no bearing whatsoever on the way the image will come out.
Even when I need to control the shutter speed, I can do that indirectly
by changing the aperture, the Exposure Value, and the ISO sensitivity
(or all three).

One last bit of advice that I offer is to *stay away from Program
mode*. Even professional photographers occasionally use Program mode
when the situation calls for it, but by and large, you will learn a lot
more about your camera and about the fundamentals of photography by
adjusting the settings yourself, making mistakes, and picking up new
experiences.
