I am a member of what some might call "the inner circle" over at B&H
Photo. If you haven't heard of them, B&H is only the largest photography
retailer in the USâ€”their two-story space in New York City is tens of
thousands of square feet in size!

I have purchased countless thousands of dollars of equipment from them
through the years, and I've always been completely satisfied with their
prices and their service. I wouldn't bother promoting them if I didn't
really believe in them, and you will be hard pressed to find someone who
doesn't think they're at the very top of their game.

That said, here are some current specials they're running that might be
of use to you. If you click on any of these links and then make a
purchase of some kind, they'll toss me a couple of percent, which will
help me continue to give you all this fabulous information, and I will
forever love you for it.

For only a little while longer, [*free express shipping on Canon
cameras*!](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/shop/14655/FreeShipping_on_Canon.html)?BI=1816&KBID=2457

I'm a total "Canonista," so if you have even the slightest inkling of a
desire for a Canon DSLR, now is the time to snag one, on sale, with free
shipping. The 40D, the 50D, the 5D, the 5D Mark II (maybe wait until
they get that black pixel thing fixed...), the Rebel XTi, the Rebel XS,
*all with free express shipping*.

If you were thinking about getting an entry-level Canon DSLR and the 40D
seems like a good fit for you, now is the time. [Get *\$50 off* the
B&H
kit](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/518570-REG/Canon_1901B017_EOS_40D_SLR_Digital.html?BI=1816&KBID=2457,)
which includes the EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens. Yes, I know it's not
"L" glass, but for someone getting started, 28-135mm is the kind of zoom
range that will give you some serious flexibility, and it's not one of
those junky EF-S lenses that you won't be able to use with the 5D or 5D
Mark II or 1D if you ever upgrade. Not to mention image stabilization;
you can't go wrong there.

Just look at that sweet baby. Go ahead, click it. You know you want to.
It's not too late to buy yourself a little holiday gift!
