The [Mystic Aquarium and Institute for
Exploration](http://www.mysticaquarium.org/) (or MAIFE, as they
abbreviate it) is located smack in the center of Mystic, Connecticut,
and the area they call [Old Mystick
Village](http://www.oldmysticvillage.com/) (that's not a typo...). The
whole Mystic area is one of the hottest tourist spots in Connecticut (it
wouldn't be a reach to say it's the _only_ tourist spot in
Connecticut), and the Mystic Aquarium and nearby Mystic Seaport are
popular summer destinations for Connecticut families and visitors from
out of state alike.

The aquarium is ripe with photographic subjects. Tank after tank of
exotic, colorful fish; beluga whales; touching tanks filled with sea
stars, coral, and so forth are all dying to be made into beautiful
images. On a busy day like Saturday, the first day I went, you'll be
surrounded by people wielding their point-and-shoot cameras like
claymores, blasting their body-mounted flashes directly into the tanks.

The greatest challenge to photographing at the aquarium (this applies
only to the indoor tanks) is getting enough light. Even the most
brightly lit tanks provide much less light than you think, most often
because your eyes have become accustomed to the darkness and your brain
is working to normalize everything you see.

For this trip, I brought only my Canon 50mm f/1.4, which I kept at f/1.4
almost the entire time. I often had to push my 5D to its highest
sensitivity, the equivalent of ISO 3200, and even then I couldn't always
get a shutter speed fast enough to handhold for the shot, much less to
freeze the motion of a quickly swimming fish. The aquarium will
definitely put your skills *and* your equipment to the test.

In an ideal world, such as a sponsored shoot (not to imply that
assignments are often, if ever, ideal), much brighter lights and
possibly even softboxes might be employed to make the scene more
technically feasible. If I had my way, I would place a single softbox or
flash with diffuser above the tank where the standard light source is
located and fire it with a PocketWizard or similar. Light that comes
through the surface of the water has a wonderful, shimmering quality to
it that most people recognize immediately.

Of the 180 or so photographs I made on this excursion, only about five
of them were good enough to toss up here. The major problem was, as I
said before, not getting enough light. Even when the classic "focal
length reciprocal rule" indicated that I should be able to handhold the
shot, the fish I was trying to capture was moving too quickly. My
problems were compounded by the 50mm f/1.4 being a fairly mediocre lens
and suffering from a good deal of chromatic aberration and vignette
(which I don't mind too much, but it bears mentioning).

[![21may07-05.jpg](http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1352/564426163_dc03a77d00_o.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/singleservingphoto/564426163/ "21may07-05.jpg by AaronBieber, on Flickr")

I attempted to use Lightroom's "lens correction" features to fix the
chromatic aberration, but rather than having one of the two "classic"
(and somewhat subtle) forms of aberration, the lens demonstrates what is
often referred to simply as "purple fringing," which means you're
basically out of luck. Add to that the fact that most of the images were
pretty blurry and you can see where I'm going with this. That having
been said, I think these five photos are fairly nice catches (no pun
intended) out of a big group of rejects.
