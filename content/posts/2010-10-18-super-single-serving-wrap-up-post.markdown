On September 25th, 2010â€”embarrassingly for me, nearly a month ago
nowâ€”Single-Serving Photo turned five. What started as an exhibitionist
experiment to see if I could force myself to take at least one decent
photograph every day turned into a kind of monument to my own
photography obsession and my fondness for sharing and learning together
with the Internet.

Looking back on these five years, there are some particular posts that
stand out in my mind. Many of them, as you might imagine, are irrelevant
to most of my visitors. If only there was some way that I could find out
which articles the Internet loves the most...

Fortunately, since mid-2007, I have been using _Google Analytics_ to
record and analyze the traffic on this site. I thought, since this is
sort of an anniversary of the blog, it would be appropriate to share
some of the gems from these last four years that I have on record.

Without further ado, the *Super Single-Serving Wrap-Up*!~~MORE~~

## Top Five Most-Read Posts

In terms of pure traffic, these posts are by far the most popular,
either because they attract the largest number of visitors who are
searching for something and found it here, or they were mentioned or
linked from other sites the most.

### 5

With *2,002* total unique pageviews, [Art Concepts in Photography,
Part 2:
Composition](/articles/2007/08/26/art-concepts-in-photography-part-2-composition/)
comes in fifth.

This was the second part of a rather short-lived series of articles I
did on the high-level design concepts relevant to photography. Though I
enjoyed writing them all, this chapter on composition is probably the
most widely applicable, so I can understand why it's so popular.

### 4

Coming in at *2,501* unique pageviews, and possessing the distinction
of being quite possibly one of my own personal favorites of all time,
[Histograms,
Huh?](/articles/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/) claims
fourth place.

I wrote this article when I, myself, was exploring Photoshop as a
post-processing tool, and although I knew in my mind what a histogram
did, I wanted to explore all of the details of its behavior and share
that with you, my loyal reader. Using a more illustrative approach than
I was ever able to find, I explain exactly what a histogram does.

### 3

Claiming, quite rightfully in my opinion, third place with *2,847*
unique views is [Mastering the Only Five Camera
Settings](/articles/2008/06/30/mastering-the-only-five-camera-settings/.)

In the technically dense content of this article lies the answer to
virtually every question I have ever been asked by beginner and
intermediate photographers during my workshops. The fundamental
balancing act among each of the five variables you, as the creator, may
control is the crux of the craft of photography and the foundation for
everything else you will ever learn. This article is deserving of its
third place position.

### 2

Due most likely to its contentious proposition, second place is claimed
by [Why Bubble Levels Are a Waste of
Money](/articles/2007/10/10/why-bubble-levels-are-a-waste-of-money/,)
with *3,905* unique pageviews.

It was a lot of fun to write this diatribe against a small, fluid-filled
piece of plastic that, at around \$25, is likely to be one of the least
expensive items in any photographer's kit. Still, the fact that they
probably make them for \$0.50 and my lasting belief that they are
utterly useless combine to power this article nearly to the top of the
list.

At the end of the article I concede that shooting panoramas might
warrant the use of a bubble level. Since then I've gone out to
Yellowstone and shot multiple panoramas hand-held, so really, don't buy
a bubble level, they're a waste of money.

## 1

Finally, numero uno, the king, the absolutely most trafficked article on
the entire site... With a whopping *12,343* unique pageviews, which is
*three times more* than the second place article, and *almost twice*
the pageviews that my *front page* receives, is...

[Neutral Density
Filters](/articles/2008/02/21/neutral-density-filters/.)

I know. I have no idea why this article is so popular. According to
Analytics, the number one traffic source for this page is the popular
social link site [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com), which
contributed the lion's share of pageviews. Apparently there are a lot of
photographers on StumbleUpon.

My reason for writing this article on what seems like, and in point of
fact really is, a numbingly boring topic was my search for neutral
density filters to add to my kit. When I started researching, I
immediately discovered that several scales are used to measure their
opacity (or "density," actually), so I decided to figure out what was
going on and share it with everyone.

Apparently it was very helpful for a bunch of folks.

So that wraps up this wrap-up. I hope you had fun skimming over the top
five most popular articles I've written in the past few years, and if
you have any favorites of your own, feel free to drop them into the
comments. I always welcome comments from you guys, you're the best
readers in the world. Because you're reading my blog. And because you're
awesome. The two things go hand-in-hand, really.
